- A shift from Tree to Graph (Network)...
- Network, unlike Tree, does not have a single origin, a single base class, or a top-down structure...
- Although Trees won't lose their utility, but, have we, now, started considering Networks to be far more evolved and appropriate structures to represent complex systems, such as 'knowledge'...
- Apart from examples brought out in this talk, few that came to my mind...
	- Origin of Universe (big bang theory proposes, single origin/time, where everything started, but now that's being questioned)
	- Many established religions/faiths subscribe to a single book/god/prophet, but some don't, like Hinduism
