# Machine Learning for Mechanical Engineers
Elective course for TY BTech students at the College of Engineering Pune

The course must be a trendsetter so that it can be replicated elsewhere. Even IITB mech does not have it. IITB Comp Sc has it but looks more mathematical/algorithmic than application oriented
