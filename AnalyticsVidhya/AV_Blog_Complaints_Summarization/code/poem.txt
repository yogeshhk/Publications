	To see a world in a grain of sand,
	And a heaven in a wild flower,
	Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
	And eternity in an hour.

	A robin redbreast in a cage
	Puts all heaven in a rage.

	A dove-house fill'd with doves and pigeons
	Shudders hell thro' all its regions.
	A dog starv'd at his master's gate
	Predicts the ruin of the state.

	A horse misused upon the road
	Calls to heaven for human blood.
	Each outcry of the hunted hare
	A fibre from the brain does tear.

	A skylark wounded in the wing,
	A cherubim does cease to sing.
	The game-cock clipt and arm'd for fight
	Does the rising sun affright.

	Every wolf's and lion's howl
	Raises from hell a human soul.

	The wild deer, wand'ring here and there,
	Keeps the human soul from care.
	The lamb misus'd breeds public strife,
	And yet forgives the butcher's knife.

	The bat that flits at close of eve
	Has left the brain that won't believe.
	The owl that calls upon the night
	Speaks the unbeliever's fright.

	He who shall hurt the little wren
	Shall never be belov'd by men.
	He who the ox to wrath has mov'd
	Shall never be by woman lov'd.

	The wanton boy that kills the fly
	Shall feel the spider's enmity.
	He who torments the chafer's sprite
	Weaves a bower in endless night.

	The caterpillar on the leaf
	Repeats to thee thy mother's grief.
	Kill not the moth nor butterfly,
	For the last judgement draweth nigh.

	He who shall train the horse to war
	Shall never pass the polar bar.
	The beggar's dog and widow's cat,
	Feed them and thou wilt grow fat.

	The gnat that sings his summer's song
	Poison gets from slander's tongue.
	The poison of the snake and newt
	Is the sweat of envy's foot.

	The poison of the honey bee
	Is the artist's jealousy.

	The prince's robes and beggar's rags
	Are toadstools on the miser's bags.
	A truth that's told with bad intent
	Beats all the lies you can invent.

	It is right it should be so;
	Man was made for joy and woe;
	And when this we rightly know,
	Thro' the world we safely go.

	Joy and woe are woven fine,
	A clothing for the soul divine.
	Under every grief and pine
	Runs a joy with silken twine.

	The babe is more than swaddling bands;
	Every farmer understands.
	Every tear from every eye
	Becomes a babe in eternity;

	This is caught by females bright,
	And return'd to its own delight.
	The bleat, the bark, bellow, and roar,
	Are waves that beat on heaven's shore.

	The babe that weeps the rod beneath
	Writes revenge in realms of death.
	The beggar's rags, fluttering in air,
	Does to rags the heavens tear.

	The soldier, arm'd with sword and gun,
	Palsied strikes the summer's sun.
	The poor man's farthing is worth more
	Than all the gold on Afric's shore.

	One mite wrung from the lab'rer's hands
	Shall buy and sell the miser's lands;
	Or, if protected from on high,
	Does that whole nation sell and buy.

	He who mocks the infant's faith
	Shall be mock'd in age and death.
	He who shall teach the child to doubt
	The rotting grave shall ne'er get out.

	He who respects the infant's faith
	Triumphs over hell and death.
	The child's toys and the old man's reasons
	Are the fruits of the two seasons.

	The questioner, who sits so sly,
	Shall never know how to reply.
	He who replies to words of doubt
	Doth put the light of knowledge out.

	The strongest poison ever known
	Came from Caesar's laurel crown.
	Nought can deform the human race
	Like to the armour's iron brace.

	When gold and gems adorn the plow,
	To peaceful arts shall envy bow.
	A riddle, or the cricket's cry,
	Is to doubt a fit reply.

	The emmet's inch and eagle's mile
	Make lame philosophy to smile.
	He who doubts from what he sees
	Will ne'er believe, do what you please.

	If the sun and moon should doubt,
	They'd immediately go out.
	To be in a passion you good may do,
	But no good if a passion is in you.

	The whore and gambler, by the state
	Licensed, build that nation's fate.
	The harlot's cry from street to street
	Shall weave old England's winding-sheet.

	The winner's shout, the loser's curse,
	Dance before dead England's hearse.

	Every night and every morn
	Some to misery are born,
	Every morn and every night
	Some are born to sweet delight.

	Some are born to sweet delight,
	Some are born to endless night.

	We are led to believe a lie
	When we see not thro' the eye,
	Which was born in a night to perish in a night,
	When the soul slept in beams of light.

	God appears, and God is light,
	To those poor souls who dwell in night;
	But does a human form display
	To those who dwell in realms of day.
