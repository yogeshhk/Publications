Jottings:
- Nervous system functions : 
	- Sensation
	- Perception (spotlight/attention)
	- Feeling
	- Thoughts
	- Actions
	- Triggering immune system
- Brain has abstractions of everything around
- Abstractions converge at physical phenomenon easily bit also at things like rewards, punishments
- Brain outside skull+spinal chord: neural retina, behind eye, not attached to brain. See sunrise and sunset to trigger activities.
- Growth Mindset:
	- Dopamine: Pursuit of goal and not much at the achievement of it. Attachment of rewards to efforts
	- Serotonin/Oxytocin: Attachment of rewards to goals achievement
- Fear: Act in the fearful situation, lateral eye movements are associated with forward-movement, and thus, action.
- (my wording) Even if you get external assistance (luck) in your success, you become confident enough to win future battles.
- Solution for stress-fear is Forward movement (gets dopamine)
- Reward incremental steps, say, run around a block.
- Tom Bilyeu - Success is not guaranteed but the struggle is.
- Hypnosis: relaxing nervous system and opens possibility of nuro plasticity, in contrast, in high alert situation (talking, planing, brain is linear, if then then that). For re-wiring, need deep rest
- Deep rest: diaphragmatic breathing, tells brain to be active-rest accordingly (phrenic nerve).
- Heightened states of focus by Heavy breathing (Wim Hof), then calm, with double-inhale and long exhale
- One change to make: 2-10 minutes of bright light at sunrise
