Jottings:
- History Centralism
- Aim: explains what is distinct about Hinduism
- Western Universalization: assimilating other faiths in their own.
- Abrahamic (Jews version, Christians, Islam) faith’s basic difference with Hinduism. They are 3 history centric religions. Only one prophet from history, whom no one can challenge/ negotiate, cannot have alternate path. Leads to Believers vs non-believers (in Hinduism, don’t we have astik/nastik darshanas, are both respected??). This is a poison pill to avoid getting digested in - Hinduism (like Jesus is avatar, lived in India etc)
- ‘Original Sin’: Adam and Eve committed a sin of eating an apple and gave birth – progeny. All are born sinners. Jesus got crucified to take away your sins (redemption). Why Jesus is not sinner as others, as he is not born like the rest (male-female) but to a virgin. 
- Judaism is version 1.0 (old testament/Torah). Christianity accepts Judaism but becomes version 2.0. Judaism does not accept 2.0 i.e. Jesus is the saviour messiah. Islam says both the previous versions listed in Quran but are corrupt and thus the version 3 is perfect and there cannot be further versions.
- Pruvapaksh: studying others, differences with others, not to criticize but to highlight them and just reject theory of ‘’sameness’’ and avoid digestion into Hinduism.  There cannot be only one exclusive avatara. Etc. Let’s not facilitate digestion of Hinduism
- Others have studied (gazed at) us from superiority vantage point and we thought (mistakenly) that we must of good!! But they studied with their model/beliefs. We cant we reverse the gaze and study them. 
- The Abrahamic Tiger has digested the Egyptian, Greek, Roman and even the Enlightenment deer and thus remains a tiger still, not a deer. Need to preserve Hindu Identity (know Christian Yoga??!!)
- Hindus claim their ideas apply as laws of the cosmos whether you believe in them or not. Laws are independent of belief. But they are ``truth-claims’’. Karma-reincarnation is a truth-claim I have; and original sin, virgin birth and redemption are your truth-claims. X may not believe in Y's truth-claims, but according to Y his truth-claims still apply to X. Given this state of affairs, I advocate mutual respect between faiths.

- Mohandas Pai $=>$ Idea of monotheistic faith is against human freedom (Hindu individual can chose his own path!!!). Conversions are to be avoided to preserve this freedom (even freedom of Christians to practice their own region), else one will go to a very rigid/non-negotiable/bonded way.
[Roddam Narasimha, Aerospace scientist at the talk] => Indian traditions allow good balance between rules and freedom. E.g. Indian classical music. Compositions/Ragas are strict, but your rendition can be different (has to be so, still abiding the rules). That’s the creativity. 
- Argument against `sameness’:  Sameness is symmetrical, if X == Y then Y has to be == X. At some abstraction they could be same, but at lower levels they are distinct. Tiger and Deer, both are `animals’, so are the same? At very high (and useless) level. My example: Brother and sister are both humans, but can brother be/replace sister or vice versa. Differences are distinct and not interchangeable. Respect the difference, without conversions.
- It is the right insight into the richness of Oneness that oneness that includes all differences as aspects within itself.
