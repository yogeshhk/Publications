\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Ch1 : A Peak into the Human Mind}
Mind's limitations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Brain cannot multi-task, for non-routine tasks (``The Mind is flat'' - Chater)
\item Our memory is weak, retrieval is fuzzy.
\item These limitations affect decision making and make mind manipulatable.
\item ``Rashoman Effect'': human perceptions are subjective and not objective, e.g. picture: old lady nose or young lady face.
\item Due to these limitations, mind takes shortcuts, simplifies, heuristics, patterns, biases, cultural stereotypes, etc.
\item Remedies: repetitive practice molds brain for consistent outcomes. Others: simplicity, specialization and spiritualization.
\end{itemize}
