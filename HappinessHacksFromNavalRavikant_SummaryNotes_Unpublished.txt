- Happiness is the absence of suffering
- “I say yes. To everything that happens, I say yes.” This acceptance—not resisting what is—is a key tenet of Buddhist philosophy
- “look up and smile.” Smiling—even if you’re faking it
- you should choose your friends very wisely, passionate, intelligent and positive
- You always have three choices: You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. If you want to change it, then that is a desire. And that will cause you suffering until you successfully change it. So don't pick too many of those. Pick one big desire in your life at any given time to give yourself purpose and motivation.
- There is the hack where I try to interpret any event in a positive manner instead in a negative way.
- There are relaxation hacks that I do that come out of Yoga Nidra. I check my body and I relax every part of it.
- There is a 'be here now' hack, where I just look at the moment and clear my thoughts.
- There is walking in nature. I look at the birds and trees. It helps clear your mind. Seeing how nature goes about its business in the most effortless way can make you very present.
- I look at someone I love regardless of what they do for me, true love.
