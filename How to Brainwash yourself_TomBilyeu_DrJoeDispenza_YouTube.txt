Jottings:
- Theme: Mind derived health optimization
- if our thoughts can make us sick, so, on contrary, thoughts can make us well, too!!
- Habit is unconscious, automated, thoughts, behaviors and emotions that are acquired by repetition
- Emotions are end products of past experiences
- How you think creates your state of being. So familiar/problematic past becomes future.
- By age 35, 95% of you is hardwired by habits. 5% is aiming to break free and be healthy/happy/etc!!
- To break free from hardwiring: Meditation.
- Breaking is not easy. Its uncomfortable and scary, because its unpredictable.
- Create future in the unknown.
- Visualizing the desired future and the reality, is blur to the brain.
- Meditation, close eyes, less stimulations going in, disconnect. Routines break. New you for new future.
- Meditation: know thyself
- No one can remain in stressed state for long, thats disease, makes us sick.
- Survival mode: stress. Creative mode: happy emotions.
- Meditation helps reduce bad health effects, may lengthen life.
- People need less things from outside to make them happy, regulate mood.
