\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet,noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item Ancient geometry by Babylonians, Egyptians, Indians was 2D-Planar. Measuring land, building pyramids etc.
\item 13 volumes of ``The Elements'' by Euclid in 300 BC laid the foundation. Based 465 theorems on 5 postulates and 5 common notions. %Things which are self-evident, and independent, are called ``axioms'' (or postulates). 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] A straight line segment can be drawn between two points.
	\item[2.] Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely.
	\item[3.] A circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.
	\item [4.] All right angles are congruent.
	\item [5.] If two lines with the sum of the inner angles less than 180, then they intersect if extended far enough.
	\end{itemize}
\item 
Euclid's fifth postulate cannot be proven as a theorem, although this was attempted by many people
\item On Curved surface, parallel lines meet. Sum of internal angles is more than 180, as each of base angle was 90.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet,noitemsep,nolistsep]

\item  Bolyai wrote 26 page paper ``Science of Absolute Space''
\item According to Euclid, one line can be drawn parallel to a given line at a point outside. According to Lobachevsky and Bolyai, mutiple and according to Rheimann, none.

\frametitle{Riemann, Hilbert and Hardy: Zeta functions}
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet,noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item Hilbert's 23 ``Unsolved Problems in Mathematics'' had ``Fermat's Last Theorem'' and Zeta functions were 8th
\item $\zeta(x) = \sum \limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^x}$, with $x=1$ is a divergent series. Riemann found $\zeta (2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$. For $x=4,6$, in terms of $\pi^4, \pi^6$. But could not still find $\zeta (3),\zeta (5),\zeta (7)$. Not for negative $x$.
\item Hilbert's doctoral thesis on ``Theory of Invariants''. Redeveloped Euclid's geometry to propose 21 hypothesis. 
\item Einstein got help from Hilbert in the ``General Theory of Relativity'' and never denied it also.
\item At Trinity, Hardy and Littlewood wrote 100 papers.
