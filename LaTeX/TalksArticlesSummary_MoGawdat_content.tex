\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Setting Up the Equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Everyone seeks happiness as much as they seek air to breathe
	\begin{itemize}
	\item It’s that feeling where everything seems right and you wouldn’t mind if time stood still
	\item We search for happiness when we realize it has always been inside us, a design feature
	\item Success is not an essential prerequisite to happiness
	\end{itemize}
\item The easiest way to spend 10,000 hours doing something to become great at it?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Doing something that makes you happy
	\item Whatever it is we do in our lives should directly solve for happy
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Setting Up the Equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Document your own list of things that make you happy
	\begin{itemize}
	\item “I feel happy when….” (complete the sentence)
	\item Writing this list actually makes you happy, and he does this weekly to reinforce an attitude of gratitude 
	\end{itemize}
\item Happiness happens when life seems to be going your way
	\begin{itemize}
	\item You feel happy when life behaves the way you want it to
	\item The opposite is true. Unhappiness is when your reality does not match your hopes and expectations
	\item Happiness $=>$ your perception of the events of your life – your expectations of how life should behave
		\begin{itemize}
		\item It’s not the event that makes us unhappy, it’s the way we think about it that does
		\item When we choose to let our painful thoughts and suffering to linger and ruminate in our kind, the more we make ourselves needlessly suffer
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\item Happiness starts with a conscious choice
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{6-7-5}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fun is a painkiller because it mimics happiness by switching off the excessive thinking that overwhelms our brains for a while
	\begin{itemize}
	\item With no thoughts, we rerun to our default, childlike state: happiness
	\item Fun, gratifying things we seek to give us that painkiller leads to us always striving for more extreme painkillers
	\item Set a daily quota of fun, positive activities as a happiness supplement
	\end{itemize}
\item Joy is when thoughts are no longer even needed because the analysis has ended and the equation has permanently been solved
 \item “The gravity of the battle means nothing to those at peace” tattoo on his son’s back
\item True joy is to be in harmony with life exactly how it is: Joy is attaining uninterrupted happiness
\item Eliminate 6 illusions, fix the 7 blind spots, and hang on to 5 ultimate truths
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Little Voice in Your Head}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Illusion of Thought: you are not your thoughts
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Those thoughts are there to serve you, and up to you to act upon
	\item You are the boss who tells you what to do, not your thoughts 
	\end{itemize}
\item Three types of thought that our brain produces:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Insightful – used in problem-solving
	\item Experiential – focused on the task at hand
	\item Narrative – chatter 
	\end{itemize}
\item Observe the dialogue of your thoughts
\item Your brain can be primed just by bringing a thought into your consciousness
\item The easiest way to become happy is just to be happy: Remove the unhappy thought, replace it with a happy one, and let the rest take care of itself 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Who Are you?}

{\em Our ego and identity is tied up to our perceived image to the outside world. And we tend to fight to try and hold onto that identity that we’ve cultivated due to suicidal expectations and pressures}

\begin{itemize}
\item The happiness equation malfunctions completely because the expectation others will buy into our fake image is never satisfied and we feel unhappy
\item Analogy: life is like the coffee that people want, but they focus so much on how good-looking the cup is that they stress themselves out if they don’t have a fancy cup: If you want to live a stress-free life, ignore the cup and just enjoy the coffee
\item Like a Russian doll, you need to remove the layers one by one, trying to distinguish the real you from the roles you’ve assumed over the years until you find your pure self
\item As much as you might think so, you are not the star of the movie
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Most of what happens around you isn’t about you at all
	\item Events are neither good nor bad in the context of the larger perspective
	\item There are infinite numbers of other movies, you were just a supporting actor: It will really help your happiness if you start to look at life this way
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What you Know?}
\begin{itemize}
\item “Real knowledge it’s to know the extent of one’s ignorance” - Confucius
\item Be an explorer, a seeker of the truth, always ready to admit being wrong in order to continue the quest
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Does Anybody Know What Time Is?}


\begin{itemize}
\item Time is relative per the Theory of Relativity
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Einstein says time and space are connected in a 4-dimensional structure called Space-Time
	\item The pull of gravity actually slows time down, so passing by a black hole will slowdown time significantly
	\end{itemize}

\item Time is experienced differently by different people and different cultures
\item Time plays a big role in perpetuating and creating unhappiness
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Happy emotions are mostly anchored in the present moment
	\item Every unhappy or stressful thought exists outside of the here and now, while every observation of the here and now eases you into a peaceful place: When you remove the timestamps from your thoughts, there will be nothing unhappy left to think about
	\item If you want to be happy, live in the here and now: Whatever you’re upset about is rooted in a past you cannot change or a future that may turn out to be completely different from what you expect
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Houston, We have a problem!!}
\begin{itemize}
\item With so many things out of our control the two things in our control are our actions and our attitude
\item Movie reference: Life Is Beautiful
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Might As Well Jump}
\begin{itemize}
\item Everyone is afraid of something: Fear is the granddaddy of all illusions
\item Pain is just a thought, and your brain can ignore it: You can learn to suppress it or enjoy it like muscle soreness from working out
\item The first step is to acknowledge our fears and face them
\item What keeps us alive and propels us forward is not our fears but our actions
\item Taking action will reduce your fears: Ask: what is the best that can happen?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Is it True?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Worrying is the brain’s default position: The evidence shows that most of us tend to be negative most of the time
\item What we perceive is mostly filtered, allowing us only a tiny sliver of the truth
\item Blindspots:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Filters
	\item Assumptions
	\item Predictions
	\item Memories
	\item Labels
	\item Emotions
	\item Exaggeration
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Right Here, Right Now}
\begin{itemize}
\item Schedule in “me-time” for yourself
\item When you’re feeling busy and overwhelmed, just stop: Practice awareness and noticing things around you in your life
\item Timeless time: give yourself the luxury of a timeless experience at least once a week
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Take yourself to a quiet spot where you have no access to anything with the time
	\item While doing an activity, put your full attention and awareness into that activity
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Pendulum Swing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Try reframing ambition so that the focus is on the goal of becoming a better person regardless of how you compare to others: Even better, look down instead of up and be grateful at how lucky you are
\item Gratitude is a sure path to happiness
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Love is All you Need}
\begin{itemize}
\item Love, true love, is real. All other emotions are temporary
\item They appear when a reason triggers them and disappears when that reason goes away
\item Relationships suffer because they are built on conditional love in an ever-changing world
\item There’s no happiness without love. True love delivers lasting joy
\item There’s no taking in true love: With nothing to take, there’s nothing to expect and none of the suffering that results from the missed expectations from conditional love
\item The true joy in true love is in giving it: The more love you give, the more you get back
\item The Law of Conservation or Multiplication of Love: Love never goes to waste: The more you give it away, the more loved you will feel
\item Even the most annoying, seemingly hateful people you meet, when you see behind the egos, fears and thought-obsessed behaviors, you will find peaceful children who just want to be loved and appreciated
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Once loved, most of them drop the masks and turn real
	\item Gently remove the mask of ego and love what you see underneath
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Love is All you Need}
\begin{itemize}
\item Love yourself. How can you love anything or expect anything to love you if you don’t love yourself?: Nothing causes more unhappiness in the world today then the widespread deprivation of self-love
\item Jot down everything about you that’s positive or admirable
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Force yourself to write at least one thing per day that you’re proud of
	\item Write down every compliment you receive, who said it, and when
	\item Go back and revisit whenever you feel you’re not good enough
	\end{itemize}

\item Be kind. Giving to those you love often feels even better and keeping for yourself
\item The ultimate form of giving is forgiving
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{L. I. P. (Live In Peace)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The physical world, the world around us, is observer-dependent: Life must have existed before the big bang in order to observe it into existence
\item The physical self is an illusion. Life is not the body that is subject to the limitations of space-time: The real you is the observer, not the physical form that represents you. That is what life really is
\item Death scares us because we are comfortable with the familiarity of this life
\item Our mortality ironically is a life coach
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Before you die, you might as well live a happy life
	\item Let’s learn to find happiness despite death, or even because of death
	\end{itemize}

\item Like every other truth, accepting that will set you free: But first, it will really piss you off
\item Life is like a game in which the difficulty makes it fun, whereas easy would make it boring
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Life is similar to a game in that we enter this level through a portal called birth and then leave it through death where we enter the next level
	\item Could this life be one level in a larger game?
	\item Most religious and spiritual teachings seem to believe this to be true, in that death is just a portal to another life, and we never really die just our physical form
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{L. I. P. (Live In Peace)}
Three lessons that teach us how to live a worthy life:

\begin{itemize}
\item Death is inevitable so accept it
\item Life is now. Birth and death are like the covers of a book, but what really matters are the stories that fill the pages in between
	\begin{itemize}
	\item How would you live if you knew today was your last day?
	\item More importantly, why are you not living that way today when you know that it may well be your last?: Every day, a version of you and everyone else dies and never returns. Don’t let any of them pass unappreciated
	\end{itemize}
\item Life is a rental. Everything we have will be left behind so why do we focus so much on our possessions?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Nothing is really yours, then nothing can be lost: Find freedom in that
	\item Letting go and allowing things to leave from your life allows for space and new things to come in
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Who Made Who?}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is no scientific way to prove something does not exist, such as a designer of the universe: You cannot prove a negative
\item Since neither side of the Grand Design debate cannot conclusively prove they’re right, it’s all a matter of probability: It is a question of which side is more likely to be true
\item Doing the math, it takes way more time and possibilities to create the universe than its age, almost impossible without intervention: Factoring in entropy in which things have a tendency towards chaos, and it decreases the odds
\item Similar to how it’s possible an Audi could appear randomly with enough chances, but it’s not probable: We cannot think the car would be produced by evolution alone. If the universe had infinite time to try, then maybe. But that is a myth
\item Age of universe since Big Bang is about 13.7 billion years. Earth = 4.5 billion. Primitive Life = 3.7 billion years ago: It’s very short for a task like creation
\item Ultimately the math is clear, nothing is random. We’re all a part of a grand design
The designer doesn’t run the show, his equations do
	\begin{itemize}
	\item But you don’t have to worry about the all the equations
	\item Focus on your happiness equation as it’s the only one you can fully control
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
