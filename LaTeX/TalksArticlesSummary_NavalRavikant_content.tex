\begin{itemize}
\item There is no skill like Business.
\item Business cannot be learnt in school

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How do you get to peace?}

	\begin{itemize}

	\item If everything is fine, you’re not doing any physical or mental activity to change it. 
	\item You’re also not wishing you were doing something to change it, because that creates stress. 
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{1. Reading will change your life}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``I always spent money on books''
\item ``I never viewed that as an expense''. 
\item ``That’s an investment to me''
\item  Permit yourself to quit once it becomes boring. No Sunk (lost) cost (time) logic. You have spent so much time on it, so , its a must to finish it. No!!
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{2. Think long-term}

\begin{itemize}
\item  Realize that things will take time. Success will take time. Fixing
something will take time.
\item ``The best things in life, come as compound interest''
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{3. Self-esteem is the relationship you have with yourself}

\begin{itemize}
\item Self-esteem is, essentially, self-respect
\item  The more you do good things — the more you respect yourself and love yourself. 
\item Every time
you lie, you lie to yourself. And you gradually start to love yourself less and have low self-
esteem.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{4. Use leverage to build a fortune}
In order to get rich, you need:
\begin{itemize}
\item Specific knowledge
\item Accountability (brand)
\item Leverage (amplification)
\begin{itemize}
\item Labor: Delegation, paying to get folks to do tasks
\item Capital: money brings monery
\item  Code and Media: easy replication (near zero marginal cost)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{5. Become the best at what you do}

\begin{itemize}
\item  You can be the best at something small, niche — in
fact, that’s the easiest way to do so.
\item Some people are making the world a better place by just being who they are.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{6. Happiness is a habit}

\begin{itemize}
\item  The reality is life is a single-player game. You’re born alone. You’re going to die alone. All of
your interpretations are alone. All your memories are alone. You’re gone in three
generations and nobody cares. Before you showed up, nobody cared. It’s all single-player.
\item Happiness is something everybody
can train themselves for.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{7. If you want to think differently, you’ve got to read differently}

\begin{itemize}
\item  If you’re searching for success (non-average outcome), you can’t expect
to get that if you make average decisions.
\item  Almost everything that people read these days is designed for social approval
\item Forging your own path will take strength and courage.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item   Then you will do your own thing and you’re much more likely to find that
winning path.
\item  Learn to be just happy being you — with your
weird tastes, desires, and inclinations.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{9. Great people have great outcomes}

\begin{itemize}
\item   You just have to be patient.
\item  While if you wait, allow yourself to get smarter, explore the world, and make
connections, you’ll actually increase your odds of success.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{10. Desire is suffering}

Consider meditation as “self-therapy.” Instead of paying a therapist to listen to you, listen to yourself (non-judgmentally) until you accept or drop the fears.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{5}

Insight meditation lets you run your brain in debug mode until you realize that you're just a subroutine in a larger program.
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{8}

Perhaps one reason why yoga and meditation are hard to sustain is that they have no extrinsic value. Purely single-player games.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{9}

\begin{itemize}
\item My number one priority in life, above my happiness, above my family, above my work, is my own health.
\item I try and set up good systems and then the individual decisions don’t matter that matter much
\item Science is, to me, the study of truth. It is the only true discipline because it makes falsifiable predictions.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Farnam Street talk}

\begin{itemize}
\item To me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It’s not about negative thoughts. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things.
\item Happiness to me is mainly not suffering, not desiring, not thinking too much about the future or the past, really embracing the present moment and
the reality of what is, the way it is.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Farnam Street talk}

\begin{itemize}
\item I don’t believe that I have the ability to say what is going to work. 
\item Rather, what I try to do is try to eliminate what’s not going to work. 
\item It’s not about having correct judgment. 
\item It’s about avoiding incorrect judgments.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Farnam Street talk}

\begin{itemize}
\item I think all the benefits in life come from compound interest. 
\item I only want to be around people that I know I’m going to be around with for the rest of my life. 
\item I only want to work on things that I know have a long-term payout.
\item I think if you take a very long-term point of view and if you take the emotion out of it, then I wouldn’t consider those things mistakes anymore.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Farnam Street talk}

\begin{itemize}
\item Macroeconomics is a combination of voodoo complex systems and politics. 
\item You can find macroeconomists that take every side of every argument. 
\item I think that discipline, because it doesn’t make falsifiable predictions, which is the hallmark of science, it’s become corrupted.
\item I gave up macro and I embraced micro. I think it’s all micro. It’s like change yourself, then maybe change your family and your neighbor before you get into abstract concepts about I’m going to change the world.
