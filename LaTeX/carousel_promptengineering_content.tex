{\Huge Adding Roles}

\vspace{2em}
{\Large \em "Imagine you are a chef. Please explain to your assistant how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."}

\vspace{2em}
In this step, we've introduced roles: the learner takes on the role of a chef, and the teacher takes on the role of an assistant. This setting allows the learner to feel more engaged and connected to the learning process.

{\Huge Adding Constraints}

\vspace{2em}
{\Large \em ``As a chef, you have a customer who is allergic to nuts. Please explain to your assistant how to make a nut-free version of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."}

\vspace{2em}
Now we've added a constraint to the prompt, making it more challenging and thought-provoking. The learner needs to consider an alternative version due to the customer's allergy. This constraint encourages critical thinking and creativity.

{\Large \em ``As a chef, you have a customer who is allergic to nuts. Please explain to your assistant how to make a nut-free version of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Also, provide two additional creative variations of the sandwich"}

\vspace{2em}
By including examples, we foster even more creativity in the learner. They need to come up with not only a nut-free version but also two other unique variations of the classic sandwich. This encourages the learner to think outside the box and explore different possibilities.
