\item Built Ram temple at Chaphal, in a cemetery. Threw stones regarded as Gods, in the river – form of education against blind faith.
\item Approached villagers with the intention of educating young children, to teach them Sanskars and develop them as better citizens. For the kids, 100 Surya Namaskar daily. Goal for the year – 1000 Surya Namaskar. If your body is not strong, you can't serve others.
\item Everyone is the same, caste, religion is no barrier.
\item What to pray for? What to ask God? Wisdom, Capability, nothing more.

Wennabai took care of the study centre at Miraj, Akkabai took charge of Chafal and Sajjangad. He strongly reprimanded an old man who was against women participation by saying that everyone came from a woman’s womb and those who did not understand their importance were not worthy of being called a man.
