\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Effective Altruism?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Effective Altruism (EA): using evidence and reason to find the most pressing problems and most effective solutions, then acting on them.
    \item Some interventions are 100–1000x more effective than others; careful choices massively increase impact.
    \item Core principles: 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Scope sensitivity – help more when possible
        \item Impartiality – value all lives equally
        \item Scout mindset – seek truth, update beliefs
        \item Recognition of tradeoffs – every choice has opportunity costs
      \end{itemize}
    \item EA originated at Oxford, now a global community across 70+ countries.
    \item Anyone applying these principles—whether through careers, donations, or advocacy—is part of EA.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Pressing Problems \& How to Act}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Global Health \& Poverty:} 700m live on <$1.90/day. Bednets save lives at $\sim\$$5,500 per life vs. $1m+ in rich countries. GiveWell charities have saved 150k+ lives.
    \item \textbf{Pandemics:} COVID killed 21m; future outbreaks could be worse. Yet prevention receives a fraction of counterterrorism funding. EA funds research, policy, rapid trials.
    \item \textbf{AI Safety:} Advanced AI could bring abundance or existential risk. Alignment research ensures AI furthers human values, but researchers are vastly outnumbered by capability builders.
    \item \textbf{Animal Welfare:} 10bn animals suffer in factory farms yearly. EA supports corporate campaigns, advocacy, and alternative proteins to reduce suffering.
    \item \textbf{Better Decision-Making:} Forecasting, prioritization research (e.g. Metaculus, Global Priorities Institute) strengthen society’s ability to handle global challenges.
    \item \textbf{Taking Action:} 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item High-impact careers (80,000 Hours)
        \item Donate effectively (GiveWell, Giving What We Can)
        \item Found/join orgs tackling neglected issues
        \item Build communities and advocate for systemic change
      \end{itemize}
    \item Even modest contributions, if well directed, can save many lives or reduce existential risks.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Core Principles of Effective Altruism}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scope sensitivity}: prioritize saving more lives over fewer
    \item \textbf{Impartiality}: help those most in need, regardless of distance or similarity
    \item \textbf{Scout mindset}: seek truth, avoid bias, update beliefs
    \item \textbf{Recognition of tradeoffs}: limited time and money require prioritization
    \item \textbf{Expected value}: judge actions by expected impact, not certainty
    \item \textbf{Thinking on the margin}: maximize benefit of each extra resource
    \item \textbf{Consequentialism}: focus on outcomes while avoiding “ends justify means”
    \item \textbf{Openness to unusual ideas}: remain receptive as history shows consensus can be wrong
    \item \textbf{INT framework}: prioritize problems that are important, neglected, and tractable
    \item \textbf{Crucial considerations}: seek insights that could radically change strategy
    \item \textbf{Forecasting}: make predictions explicit and learn from errors
    \item \textbf{Fermi estimates}: rough calculations to compare options by expected value
