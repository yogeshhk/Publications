\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Understanding Emergence and Synergy}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Emergence: New properties arise that weren't present before (e.g., living cell from non-living molecules)
	\item Synergy: Whole systems exhibit properties not found in parts taken separately
	\item Emergent properties are fundamentally unpredictable from individual components
	\item Requires elegant ordered complexity, not just random combinations
	\item More meaningful synergies emerge from combining different elements rather than similar ones
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Attractive Forces and Evolution}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item All emergence stems from physical forces (gravity, electromagnetism) and metaphysical forces (love, shared purpose)
	\item Evolution selects for systems with most advantageous emergent properties
	\item Universe moves toward more elegant ordered complexity through self-organization
	\item Drives both increasing diversity and sophisticated unification
	\item Evolution progresses through relationship, synergy, and emergence
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Consciousness and Human Role}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Consciousness evolves: reptilian (pain/pleasure) → mammalian → neocortical → prefrontal (abstraction)
	\item Humans can understand deep past and future through abstract thinking
	\item Each individual represents unique facet of universal evolution
	\item Competition becomes obsolete as evolution favors differentiation and symbiosis
	\item Humans can consciously participate in and direct evolution
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Current Systems and Future Directions}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Global systems show simultaneous exponential improvements and degradation
	\item Modern challenges require coordinated global solutions
	\item Future requires alignment of individual incentives with collective well-being
	\item Infrastructure must shift from linear to closed-loop materials economy
	\item Success of individual inseparable from success of whole system
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Emergence in Practice}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Bringing components together requires specific patterns of order
	\item Not every relationship is synergistic - some are entropic
	\item System destabilization indicates potential phase shift
	\item Need to move from differential advantage to systemic advantage
	\item Local problems have become extinct in our interconnected world
	\end{itemize}
