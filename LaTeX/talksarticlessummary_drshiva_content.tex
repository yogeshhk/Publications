%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Introduction to the Swarm}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item The "Swarm" is a decentralized, global system, not confined to any one individual, religion, or organization.
          \item It includes both the "obvious" and "not so obvious" establishments that control society.
          \item The "obvious establishment" includes known figures such as political leaders and royals.
          \item The "not so obvious establishment" includes figures like Robert Kennedy, Trump, AOC, and others who mask their true motives.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Effects of the Swarm’s Policies}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item The Swarm creates policies that harm the biological health of society.
          \item These policies have led to early death, obesity, immune system destruction, and reduced lifespans.
          \item Lifespan trends in the U.S. show a decline from 1980 to 2023.
          \item These policies disproportionately harm children, who are dying younger than previous generations.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Not-So-Obvious Establishment}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Figures like Kennedy, Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Al Sharpton are part of the "not so obvious establishment."
          \item These individuals disguise themselves as allies while supporting harmful policies.
          \item They benefit from the same systems that exploit working-class people.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Biological Triggers of Harm}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Policies by the Swarm have led to biological dysfunctions such as mitochondrial damage, autophagy dysfunction, and oxidative stress.
          \item These dysfunctions contribute to early death and a weakened immune system.
          \item Molecular pathways affected include reduced NAD+ levels, autophagy gene downregulation, and increased oxidative stress markers.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Impact of Lockdowns}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item The Swarm’s policy of lockdowns led to stress, obesity, loneliness, depression, and poor nutrition.
          \item Both the obvious and not-so-obvious establishments supported these lockdowns.
          \item These lockdowns had devastating effects on people's physical and mental health.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Monsanto Protection Act}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item The Monsanto Protection Act allowed the destruction of the environment and the creation of genetically engineered foods.
          \item This act led to poor nutrition and environmental pollution, worsening the health crisis.
          \item Key political figures, including Elizabeth Warren, supported this act, showing the unity of both political parties in harmful policies.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Healthcare and Economic Inequality}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) expanded the healthcare system, increasing costs and reducing access.
          \item The result was more inequality, with wealth being transferred from working people to the elites.
          \item The pandemic worsened this inequality, with 600 billionaires increasing their wealth by \$2.3 trillion.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Environmental and Societal Damage}
      \begin{itemize}

          \item Environmental pollution, including noise and chemicals, exacerbated these issues.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Biological Pathways Affected}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to reduced NAD$+$ levels, affecting energy and immune function.
          \item Autophagy dysfunction impairs the body’s ability to repair cells.
          \item Oxidative stress increases reactive oxygen species, contributing to disease and early death.
          \item Inflammation, marked by CRP and COX-2, is another result of these policies.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Conclusion and Call to Action}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item The Swarm’s policies have systematically weakened our biology and society.
          \item These policies are a deliberate strategy by elites to maintain control and profit from dysfunction.
          \item To overcome this, people must awaken, reject the establishment, and get involved in the movement for truth, freedom, and health.
          \item Support the movement by engaging with educational resources and spreading awareness.
      \end{itemize}
