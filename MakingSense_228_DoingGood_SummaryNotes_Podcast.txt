Notes:
- Themes: Generosity, effective altruism, how to live morally beautiful life?
- Minimum 10% of pre-tax income to most effective charity ("Give-Well")
- Better if done anonymously? Not really!! Taking public pledge.
- Altruism needed? Be self-made?
- Your location is a major reason for one's potential to make wealth
- You didn't pick location, parents, timing and plain luck. So, not really "self"-made. Like Will in Free-Will may not be really be Free.
- Even if you feel you have earned it, why not help? Have compassion for less fortunate.
- Solutions should come from the ground. Example of failure: 25hrs on play-pump needed for one household.
- What are targets for charity? Homeless in USA or poor in Bangladesh?
- Make life boat better, to save more.
- To alleviate animal suffering: be vegetarian, support artificial meat research
- Good example: Bill Gates lives a luxurious life and donates huge sum as well, rather than deciding to live like a monk while giving away everything else. Even other rich are comfortable doing same. Don't stigmatize wealth.
