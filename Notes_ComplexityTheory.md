# Complexity Theory

## Why study?
- Needed some non-trivial, mathematical, programmable, un-common domain (like Category Theory) having glamor, universality, portability, newness and future potential. 
- Can write explanatory blogs on LinkedIn, in newspapers in Marathi, prepare course on Udemy, teach short courses, write papers, talk at conferences, do consultancy, a sustainable fields to explore in Part II of life. 
- Spans academic, government-policy, industrial, philosophical arenas.

## Introduction
- Individual ant is very simple, unsophisticated entity but its army can be extremely powerful, versatile and sophisticated entity as a collection and that too without any central command. 
- They are self organizing and follow simple rules. Same with honey-bees, neurons and birds, etc. 
- Power of numbers, decentralization, some common goal, but no authority, self-organizing, a bottoms-up agent based approach.
- Farmers don't grow wheat, but facilitate sich environment that wheat grows on its on. Like children.



## Notes
- Eli Sopow BDCON Youtube on Organization Development
	- Start with broad goals
	- Minimum specifications
	- Self Organization (auto clustering)
	- Wicked questions (devils advocate) to plug loop holes
	- Shadow systems, simulating parallel possibilities
	- emergence of specialization (let it blossom)

	- We define the complexity of a behavior as equal to the length of its description. The length of a description of a particular system’s behavior depends on the number of possible behaviors that system could exhibit. Greater the number of possible behaviors, the greater the complexity.
	- Systems with the least disorder are those in which all components exhibit the same behavior (coherent systems), and such behavior is easy to describe and thus not intuitively complex.

	- A system’s complexity profile is a plot of the system’s complexity as a function of scale. At smaller scales, there are too many details, say in a gas. But on higher scale, gas can be described by just temperature and pressure.  Random, coherent, and correlated systems have qualitatively different complexity profiles.
	- Random systems have the most complexity at the smallest scale (finest granularity/most detail), but the amount of complexity rapidly drops oﬀ as the scale is increased and the random behaviors of the individual components are averaged out.
	- A coherent system has the same amount of complexity at any scale.
	- For a correlated system, various behaviors occur at various scales, and so the complexity gradually increases as one examines the system in greater and greater detail.

	- A corollary of the trade off between complexity and scale is the trade off between adaptability and efficiency. Adaptability arises when possible actions happening in parallel, independently (high complexity).  Efficiency arises when parts are working in concert, so that the system can perform at the largest possible scale. 
	-  Law of Requisite Variety: to be effective, a system must be at least as complex as the behaviors to which it must react/respond at all scales.
	- Problems arise not from too much or too little complexity (at any scale) per se but rather from mismatches between the complexities of a task to be performed and the complexities of the system performing that task. Example: we are bored when our environment is too simple and overwhelmed when it is too complex.
	- Each subset should also react to same behaviors as the whole system.
	- If there is not much behavior between large and small scale then they can have good separation for analyzing hem ie macro and micro analysis. - 
	- Mean-field theory: average behaviors of a system’s components are explicitly modeled and the deviations of the individual components from this
average are treated as statistically independent random fluctuations. Because their small-scale random occurrences are not statistically independent, complex systems often exhibit large-scale fluctuations not predicted by mean-field theory, such as forest fires, viral content on social media, and crashes in economic markets. 
	- Human height is thin tailed distribution whereas wealth is fat tailed distribution.
	- Simile-Linear systems, i.e., they assume that the total impact of a set of factors is equal to the sum of the impacts of each individual factor, an assumption that often breaks down for complex systems, which may possess feedback loops, abrupt transitions (tipping points), and other highly nonlinear behaviors.
	- In order to thrive in uncertainty and exceed the complexity of individual decision-making, systems can incorporate evolutionary processes so that they, even if very limited at first, will naturally improve over time.  The opposite strategy would be to enact one national plan, the effects of which will not be able to be comparatively evaluated.
	- Successful evolutionary processes generally do not consist of unbridled competition but rather contain both competition and cooperation, each occurring at multiple scales.  A soccer team in which the players compete with their own team members to score goals will not be effective, but one in which the players compete for the title of the most fit may be.
