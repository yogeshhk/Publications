- Metabolism is unique for everyone and even that changes over time.
- Not just quantity but quality of calories is important.
- How fat goes:
	- fat cells die with their content (ie fat)

- Be kind. You may know the solution. Need to be aware, educated.
- Microbiome decides the obesity as well. Both that we inherit (nature) or build (nurture)
- Microbiome diversity is key, Old way,tribal, diversity food helps.
- Microbiome diversity is inverse with diabetes, insomnia and obesity.
- Be aware of food you it and the way it affects you.
- Hypothalamus is like barometer, regulates metabolism (in turn, obesity).
