- "You can afford anything but not everything", for money, time,, focus, energy, etc resources.
- Allocating limited resources with intention, based priority of self, not society.
- Financial Independence (FI): When passive income (through investments) is enough to let you survives.
- Passive Income: does not come through exchange with time. {Money that comes while you are sleeping!!], eg, rental income, 401K fund, investments, royalties, etc.
- Whats enough: to get life going, food, shelter, etc.
- FI reduces anxiety.
- Investing Philosophy: 
	- Passively managed investments, eg index fund.
	- Rental properties. Not much of flipping.
- Growing the gap, debate: Earn more or spend less. Suggestion: Growing the gap between earning and spending.
- Ge 3 Big things right, on biggest expenses: Housing, Food, Transportation
- Anti-Budget: No breakup of budgets, but spend money = Income after tax - Savings.
- Loss Aversion: Losing money feels more terrible than gaining the equal amount.
- Habit == Will power any-day. Will power is like a muscle. Strongest in the morning, weakest at night.
- Build habits are unconscious 
- Forming habits: Ref "Power of Habits"): cue, time, location, immediately preceding action, emotional states.
