PIN not recieved.


Hello,

I have issued a new Debit/ATM card for my account no. 039301509110. This charged around Rs 240 ( so unreasonable amount) for it on my account and Bank officer tells this is service charge. The card was not delivered to my home however new pin came to home . I collected card from Kondhwa branch after three consecutive visits. When i tried to use card, the card was blocked. When i went to bank next day, they requested to apply for deblocking of card. What is this ? If i issue a new card, it should come in deblocked state ? Anyways, so that wasted one more day. After that the New pin for new card was not working. I informed customer care. "They told there is some problem in CVC no. of card. Please reissue pin, it will work." I requested for new Pin in December, till date the pin is not delivered. When i enquired in Magarpatta branch. They say "The Pin is despatched on 2nd Jan. It will come the next day." Till today I am waiting.
I am just frustated with all this.
During all this new card matter, I am unable to use netbanking and ATM from almost a month now.
ICICI charges so much for such small things with pathetic service.
Even an account statement incurs around Rs. 150 or 200 ( i don't remember exactly).
Is there anybody from ICICI who can take responsibility and look into this matter ?

regards,
Ehteshaam
