Poor service, no response to customer complaints
I am Anandkumar Desai, having salary account with ICICI Bank, Chinchwad branch.
I had lost my purse and the debit card on 18/12/2011. on the same day, between 8 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. I have tried to reach to customer care executive to block my card by calling on 9890478000 35-40 times. But constantly there was a message that the number is busy kindly try after some time.
At 11:00 p.m. somehow I was able to connect with another customer service number and blocked my card and made the application for new card on the same time. The executive who has taken my application of new card, told me that I shal receive the new card within 3 working days and I will be charged by Rs. 221 for that.
On 21/12/2011, my account has been debited by Rs. 221. On 22/12/2011 I had received the PIN number for the new card but not the card. Today, on 23/12/2011, when I called again to customer care number, the executive told me that it will take around 10 days to receive a new card at your residence.

I am attaching the scan copy of the written complaint that i have made to the branch manager - Chinchwad, Pune

So, to concude,
1) Customer care numbers are not working when required
2) There are always descrepencies in the information provided by the customer care executives.

What protection is provided to the consumer for wrong information and non availability of service as and when required?
