Jottings:
- Theme: Fasting
- Over-fasting (> 10 days) not good. Thats starving or malnutrition.
- Fasting == go without (eating, digital, etc) that makes us stronger.
- Metabolic/dietary Fasting = does not increase insulin (Water + little pre-biotic fiber)
- Goals of fasting: 
	- healing gut,
	- autophagy (little fat ok), 
	- more energy, 
	- lower inflammations (absence of toxins, ketone)
- Intermittent fasting: 16 hrs Fasting, 8 hrs eat anything!!
- Ketones: body burns fats and not sure, more energy than glucose, brain loves it, more clarity
- Fasting is a practice, start slow. Don't make it painful unless for spiritual reason.
- Spending energy heavily on: 
	- Fear: run away from kill
	- Food: eat everything
	- F*: going crazy
- Fasting is a way out of above spends.
