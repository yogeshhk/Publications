## Roadmap: AI Advisor, Certification Coach \& Tech Speaker

### Phase 1: Master the Trilogy (Months 1-3)

Start with hands-on learning of **Docling** (IBM's open-source document conversion toolkit), **LangChain** (LLM application framework), and **LangGraph** (multi-agent workflows). Take the **LangChain for LLM Application Development** course by Harrison Chase and Andrew Ng on DeepLearning.AI, followed by the **AI Agents in LangGraph** course. Practice with IBM's Docling tutorials and build 3-5 portfolio projects integrating all three technologies.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10][^11][^12][^13][^14][^15][^16][^17]

### Phase 2: Get Certified (Months 2-4)

**Azure AI-900**: Entry-level certification covering AI workloads, machine learning, computer vision, NLP, and generative AI. Costs \$99, requires 700/1000 to pass. Use Microsoft's official study guide and free resources like the AI-900 Weekend Exam Cram.[^18][^19][^20][^21]

**NIST AI RMF**: Two levels available - Foundation (40 questions, 60 minutes, 70% passing) and Lead Implementer. Covers Governance, Identification, Assessment, Mitigation, and Monitoring. Study the official NIST AI RMF 1.0 documentation and ITCerts.ca resources.[^22][^23][^24][^25][^26][^27]

### Phase 3: Build Content \& Presence (Months 3-6)

Create technical blogs documenting your trilogy projects, produce YouTube tutorials, and develop comprehensive integration guides. Share your learning journey publicly through LinkedIn posts, GitHub repositories, and Twitter using \#DevRel. Documentation is a key decision factor for 72% of developers.[^2][^3][^6][^14][^28][^29][^30][^31][^32][^33][^34][^35][^36]

### Phase 4: Start Speaking (Months 4-8)

Begin with local meetups and webinars, then target major Indian AI conferences: **Cypher 2025** (Sept 17-19, Bangalore with 5,000+ attendees), **MachineCon GCC Summit** (June 19-20, Bangalore), **NASSCOM Future Forge** (Aug 7-8, Bengaluru), and **AI Visionaries Summit** (May 30-31, New Delhi).[^34][^35][^37][^38]

Design three workshop levels: beginner (Docling basics, 2-3 hours), intermediate (LangChain RAG applications, half-day), and advanced (LangGraph multi-agent systems, full-day).[^37][^39][^34]

### Phase 5: Launch Advisory Practice (Months 6-12)

Offer **AI strategy consulting** for organizations identifying AI opportunities, **certification coaching** for Azure AI-900 and NIST AI RMF, **technology implementation** guidance for the trilogy, and **responsible AI consulting** using NIST frameworks.[^6][^10][^20][^23][^24][^25][^40][^41][^42][^43][^18][^22]

Structure offerings as group coaching programs (\$299-\$499 for 8-12 week cohorts), premium 1-on-1 coaching (\$1,500-\$3,000), and corporate workshops (\$2,500-\$10,000 per day).[^44][^45]

### Phase 6: Build Thought Leadership (Months 9-12)

Become an unofficial advocate by contributing to open-source projects, answering community questions, and creating integration guides. Build your personal website showcasing portfolio and services, post 2-3 LinkedIn insights weekly, grow a YouTube tutorial library, and launch a weekly newsletter.[^3][^5][^32][^33][^35][^46][^47][^2][^18][^34]

### Immediate Action Steps

1. Enroll in DeepLearning.AI courses for LangChain and LangGraph[^11][^12]
2. Install Docling and complete first tutorial[^14][^48]
3. Register for Azure AI-900 (schedule 8-10 weeks out)[^19][^18]
4. Update LinkedIn profile with AI focus[^35][^34]
5. Join 2-3 developer communities[^49][^35]
6. Draft first blog post on your journey[^46][^34]
7. Start GitHub repo for trilogy projects[^33][^34]

**Success Metrics**: Target 10-15 talks in year one, maintain 90%+ coaching client pass rate, and track GitHub contributions, blog traffic, and social following.[^50][^18][^22][^33][^35][^37][^46]
