<!-- 
## Rational
- Being online gives unprecedented reach, scale and if not leveraged, missing a big potential (FOMO!!)
- For Giving back, from classes to masses
- If any $: if in Job, Donate 
- For better-own understanding, clarity
- Can be an individual effort to start with a small team to expand
- Create, not just Consume
- Use cartoon-doodles for explanatory sketches (USP)
- No external dependency, permission-less, infinite leverage, brand building, less risk

## IKIGAI/Specific Knowledge^/Wow^^!!: 
- World needs: huge sustainable-global need-demand for teaching
- Good at: Professional-teaching experience,PhD, Rasa Hero-Certified, GDE ML
- Love doing: teaching, part II of life, giving back, up-leveling Bottom-of-Pyramid
- Paid for: good-simple explanations, passive service

^Specific Knowledge: rare, un-trainable, only through apprenticeship 
^^Not looking for Success, but for Wonder

					-- LinkedIn Post --
			Wish to share that the upcoming session in my 'LetsAI' talk series is on 'Introduction to <>'.

			<Info about the topic>

			The talk is open and free to all. However, to grasp the content, I recommend having a decent understanding of the following topics:
			<Prerequisites>

			Please check the Google Calendar invite below and save it to your calendar to block the time slot and get a reminder. 

			<Published event link>

			Direct Google Meet call link: <link>

			Please join the call a few minutes early as Google Meet has limited seats and does not record the session. ðŸ˜ž

			If you miss the session, you can access the slide deck on my GitHub yogeshhk/TeachingDataScience repo, in LaTeX format or email me for the PDF version to myfirstnamelastname at yahoo dot com.

			The next session is tentatively planned on <which Saturday> and we will have a deeper dive into â€˜<next topic>â€™. Please share your expectations about that topic in the comments.

    - At the end of the talk, 
- Post-Talk:
    - Fill GDE Advocu and MVP entry with picture taken
    - Share beamer pdf of the talk if email comes

<!-- ## Courses Playbook
- Pick topic:
	- a bit niche and not too broad, 
	- theory or library or fast growing github repo ok. 
	- from emerging tech (Gartner Hype Cycle). 
- Establish the why of your project (how better than competition courses?)
- Gather your current materials
	- Notes, yours/others
	- Current training materials
	- Videos, Youtube links
	- Ipynb Notebooks
	- Images, digital artwork doodles/sketches
- Distill your topic into an eLearning script, skeleton, topics with rough content/agenda
- Define the visual look-and-feel of your project, just slides+voice over, with/without video
- Assemble into one cohesive course, put it as unlisted youtube for storage + gdrive
- Develop materials for your course
- Audacity: Fantastic open-source, cross-platform recording and editing software
- Using OBS: Open-source Free-ware
	- Sources: Windows Capture
	- Settings:
		- Hot Keys: Alt + 10 to start recording, Alt + F11 to stop
		- Output format : mkv, easier to mix, can be converted to mp4 by File->Remux
		- Output gets stored in Videos folder
- OpenShot to edit video, save to join
- Handbrake to compress video
