# Publications

Book summaries in presentation/cheetsheet formats, Newspaper articles, Sketchnotes for Podcasts, Books, Talks, etc.

Latest indulgence: Visual Summaries: Sketchnotes: One page summary, effective for audio (podcasts) and linear mediums like videos. At times good for random access mediums like articles or books also. 

## Why Sketchnotes?

- Information overload
- Less time & attention
- Need ready & fun gist

So, 3 Ss: Simplify, Subtract & Summarize

Podcasts (or videos or talks and to an extent even books or blogs) are black-boxes. You don't get anything unless you go through them fully. There is no preview-trailer of what's coming, wasting our time in case the topic is not interesting to you. Even if it is interesting, you many not have time to go through all that story-built-up or flamboyance (all-that-jazz) to get the core idea. One pager Summary gives much desired quick and concise overview. Just a text summary can be boring, so adding fun-pictures helps retention and interest.

One caution though, as always a quote from Einstein: Make things simple but not simpler!! Try not to have very art-y, too much colorful, cluttered-spaghetti sketchnote, but clean sparingly arty and a bit colorful with a clear path or structure to read.

## Process
- Go through source, take text notes
- Capture ideas, core concepts, quotes
- Add sketches, containers, arrows, colors.
- Portrait mode like info-graphics, colorful
- Authors' cartoons at top and my email below
- Scan, upload to github, get permlink for addition to video comments
- LinkedIn article w my witty title, nature pixabay, explanations, scan and refs
- Share it as a LinkedIn post with hashtags, @ handles for refs & source authors

Although extremely convenient for editing, storing and sharing, avoiding digital sketchnotes for now. So no Ipad Pro with an Apple pen. Wish to keep it analog.

## Basics
- Tools: Pen/Pencils and paper/notebook
- Visual vocabulary: stick figures, letterings, faces, nature, buildings, things, flowcharts, graphs, 2d/3d, connectors, containers and layout.
