- Zero Knowledge Proofs - Aryan Shah (LinkedIn)
	Zero knowledge proofs are one of the most significant crypto technologies being developed
	Here are five ways zero knowledge proofs are making dapps more #efficient, #private & #decentralised

	1. MultiPlayer games on chain - #darkforest

	DarkForest is a #multiplayer game completely on-chain where players compete in rounds. Players start on a planet & can conquer other unconquered planets or planets of other players
	The goal is to get as many points as possible

	How ZK helps?

	Both the location of the player's planet and the moves that they make are hidden from other players
	Players generate ZK proofs on their system & publish them on the blockchain where the #contract verifies that the moves they are making are valid.

	2. Private Transactions - #TornadoCash

	Tornado #cash enables users to transfer their #ETH to a different account in a private way. Users deposit ETH into a pool & can withdraw those ETH from the pool using a diff account.

	ZK helps break the link between the #deposit and #withdrawal .

	How ZK helps ?

	While depositing users submit the hash of a secret.
	While withdrawing users submit a ZK Proof that they know the secret without revealing which #secret they know.
	This enables them to #withdraw their ETH without revealing which #deposit was theirs

	3. Proof of Storage - #filecoin

	Filecoin enables everyone to store their data in a #decentralised manner.
	Every storage provider must submit two proofs
	1. Proof of replication(PoRep)- data was downloaded by provider
	2. Proof of space time(PoSt)- data is still being stored.

	How ZK helps?

	Using ZK, filecoin compresses both PoRep & PoSt from 100s of KBs to 192Bs, a reduction of 10000!. Each storage provider generates 10 ZKPs each for PoRep & PoSt respectively.
	These ZKPs can be very cheaply verified on #chain, saving both bandwidth & mining costs

	4. Private Identity & Credentials - #identhree

	Iden3 enables solutions like #polygon
	 where users share information about their data while keeping it private
	Eg. proving you are a DAO member without disclosing your #identity. Or that you are above 18 yrs w/o sharing your age

	How ZK helps?

	Users can submit proofs to the #DAO that they are one of the member addresses without revealing which #address is them

	Users can also submit proofs that they hold a valid document (>18 age) without #revealing the actual details of that document.

	5. Proof of Alpha #minaprotocol

	 helps traders & funds verify that they actually made a #profit in their trades without revealing the real #trades.
	LPs or followers can verify trader's #profitability without knowing which trades or #investments were executed.

	How ZK helps?

	Traders can link their exchange accounts to an application which fetches all their trading history.
	It generates a ZKP of the profit without revealing the actual trades.

- PRIVACY-PRESERVING DATA SCIENCE, EXPLAINED, May 19th, 2020, Private ML
	- What is Secure Multi-Party Computation?: Secure multi-party computation allows multiple parties to collectively perform
some computation and receive the resulting output without ever exposing any party’s sensitive input.
	-  A Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a mathematical method to prove that one party possesses something without actually revealing the information.

	Zero Knowledge Proof Decentralized Digital Identity - Bringing Democratic Regulatory Governance!

	Web3 industry is being built on the principles of self-sovereignty, decentralization, transparency, censorship resistance and democratic governance. 

	Governments are gradually building regulatory frameworks for consideration of this emerging industry and embrace it with its utmost potential. 

	At the same time, government agencies are reluctant towards anonymous governance of users performing illicit, fraudulent activities which can be harmful towards state nations. 

	So, we need a novel solution which bridges this gap and allows Web3 users to continue enjoying the Web3 perks, and Government agencies to bring this industry in a holistic regulatory framework. 

	The Zero Knowledge Proof Decentralized Digital Identity(ZK-DID) is a perfect solution for bridging this gap without losing dynamics of either parties. 

	The ZK-DID can help build a regulatory framework by verifying identities of each individual participating in the Web3 without giving away any sensitive information of that individual and keeping the anonymity in a decentralized network. 

	Each user possessing ZK-DID will have authenticity, self-sovereignty, anonymity, and a democratic governance of its operations across different Web3 applications. 

	At the same time, the governments can imply frameworks for the Web3 applications to have a trustless verification method without having to monitor individual activities and breach digital rights. 

	The Polygon ID is explicitly working towards allowing Web3 users to have a self-sovereign governance of their identity without having to share any personal sensitive information to prove the user authenticity. 

	Polygon ID is catalyzing the authentic Web3 user adoption while preventing Web3 applications from regulatory scrutiny. 

	Can Polygon ID act as a novice solution for the regulatory approved, self-sovereign, authentic, democratic and decentralized mass adoption of the Web 3.0 industry?

	- Asymmetric Encryption: Encrypt with one password, and decrypt with another password.
	- Modular Arithmetic, '%' or 'mod' is remainder operator: 
		14 % 10 = 4
		5 % 2 = 1
		a = b (mod n) means a and b have same remainder when divided by n
		14 = 4 (mod 10)
		If I am interested in last digit, its 'mod 10'
		If I am interested in hours, its 'mod 12'
	- Rules:
		a mod n + b mod n = a+b mod n
		You get smaller numbers, even after operations
		a mod n x b mod n = ab mod n
		What is -1 mod arithmetic? -1 mod 5 ==? its 4... its same as adding -1 and 5
		Division?? Opposite of Multiplication. 12/3 =?, ie 3 into what gives 12?
		for mod 15 arithmetic, 3 x 4 = 12; 3 x 9 = 27 mod 15 = 12, so 12/3 is it 4 as normal arithmetic or 9 as in mod arithmetic. Undefined.
		Such things occur when '3' has common factor with '15'
		Division is Multiply by Inverse giving answer 1. a x b = 1 so a = b^-1 or b = a^-1
		In mod 15 arithmetic, 4 x 4 = 16 mod 15 = 1; 7 x 13 mod 15 = 1; so 7 and 13 are inverses of each other wrt mod 15
		but for 5 x anything with mod 15, the answer is never 1, because 5 has a common factor with 15; same with 3, 6, 9, 10, etc
		a^n = a x a x ...n times, In exponential table, row^2, columns wrt say mod 21 repeat after 6...thats magic number Lambda 'L'
		In 'mod n' arithmetic: m^{L+1} = m (mod n) for all m, basically you get back original m.
		How L is calculated?  if p and q are prime numbers, and n = p x q, then L is lcm of p-1 and q-1; 21 is 3 x 7, and lcm of 3-1=2 and 7-1=6 is 6 thus things were repeating after every 6 columns.
	- send a secure message over public channel? Alice to Bob where Carol is watching
		- Alice to find two numbers e and d, if e x d = L +1, then ed mod L = 1, 
		- Use property(m^e)^d = m^{ed} in m^{L+1} = m (mod n)  becomes (m^e)^d = m^{L+1} = m mod n
		Let C = m^e mod n, then C^d = m mod n

		In public key cryptography, there are two keys. Suppose Alice wishes to receive encrypted messages; she publishes one of the keys, the public key, and anyone, say Bob, can use it to encrypt a message and send it to her. When Alice gets the encrypted message, she uses the private key to decrypt it and read the original message. If Alice needs to reply to Bob, Bob will publish his own public key, and Alice can use it to encrypt her reply.
		
		This is RSA, after Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman.
		
		Alice does: 
			- pick p and q as large prime numbers, multiply to get n, is of the required bit length, e.g. 1024 bits. 
			- then get L, L is lcm of p-1 and q-1
			- pick any random small prime number e, compute d as e inverse mod L. d = e^-1 mod L; 1 = e x d mod L; what number d times e when divided by L leave s remainder 1? 
			- Save d carefully as it is a secrete, its a private key. On public channel she send n and e. 
			- n is known as the modulus. 
			- e is known as the public exponent or encryption exponent or just the exponent.
			- d is known as the secret exponent or decryption exponent.
		
		The RSA algorithm works because, when n is sufficiently large, deriving d from a known e and n will be an impractically long calculation — unless we know p, in which case we can use the shortcut. This is why p and q must remain secret.
		
		Encryption: 
			- Bob wants to send one message m = 101 
			- Uses e declared as public key by Alice
			- He encrypts it like, C = m^e mod n = 101^11 mod 2173 = 1305, 
			- So Bob sends encrypted message '1305' to Alice.
		Decryption: 
			- Alice receives Bob’s message '1305'
			- She decrypts it with the saved private key, d, say 331, so (n = 2173, d = 331). 
			- So Alice decrypts the message like: 	plaintext = cyphertext^d mod n = 1305^331 mod 2173 = '101'
