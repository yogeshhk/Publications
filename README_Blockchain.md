# Blockchain

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.

Basically, a distributed network with a shared memory

## Me? 
- Why: Quantum jump, any XYA is earning $$$$, a must for medical/secure data
- How: become expert by hands-on, talking with local folks, teaching, doodles series
- What: Prep EVM (!NFT, no JS/Web3) and/or DAO, prep remote global service/research
- Doodle: concepts, a bit commercial w target as Polygon tech (Dev Advocate)

## Skills?
- Hyperledger: Fabric/INDY/Sawtooth/Aries
- Ethereum, Solidity, DiFi 
- with "machine learning"?:
- Crypotography: bulletproofs, IOPs, KZG-based schemes

## Follow

	- Skills from Web2 that will help.
		- Typescript, NextJS, Chakra UI, Material UI, Testing.
		- Core computer concepts (operating systems, networking) and problem solving skills are fundamental and required no matter web2 or web3.
	- Differentiating Skills
		- Knowledge of Cryptography (ECDSA - Elliptic curve cryptography, Asymmetric key cryptography).
		- Remote Procedure calls is the base of blockchain (very helpful if you already know it), WebSockets.

	- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (wallet) (use web3 to learn how it works)
		- this is a wallet used to interact with blockchain.
		- this is a very basic skill expected from a crypto user, however developer should know more than average user like how to programmatically request network change and detect current accounts and network.
		- have a look at its docs.

	- Solidity (new language) (EVM based) (For solana & near) (learn Rust)
		- Learn basics first the language is under very quick development new versions roll out pretty quick so don’t get overwhelmed.
		- Best place to start [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/).
		- Reading habit is recommended as most of the good tutorials are in text not in video format.

	- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) (Blockchain Explorer)
		- This is the blockchain explorer. You might think this is basic but there is a lot to learn here. A lot of people don't know how to read the transactions.
		- Learn all the terms mentioned in a transaction google them.
		- Learn by reading code of other popular smart contracts most of them are Open Source.
		- Learn how to verify a contract from explorer, learn how to verify using remix and then programmatically from hardhat.
	- Remix (online IDE for solidity) (beginner level) Learn how to deploy contracts.
