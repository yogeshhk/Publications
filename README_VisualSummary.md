# Visual Summary (Sketchnotes - नवनीत दर्शन)

Sketchnote is an abstraction, figuring out whats important and then mapping to appropriate symbolism, as a gist in a single page.

Latest indulgence: Visual Summaries: Sketchnotes: One page summary, effective for audio (podcasts) and linear mediums like videos. At times good for random access mediums like articles or books also.

## Why Sketchnotes? 

What problem are you solving? Purpose?

- Information overload
- Less time & attention
- Need ready & fun gist

So, 3 Ss: Simplify, Subtract & Summarize

नवनीत: eternally-new/butter(summary-सार, अमृत)
दर्शन: sight, enlightened visual manifestation

Podcasts (or videos or talks and to an extent even books or blogs) are black-boxes. You don't get anything unless you go through them fully. There is no preview-trailer of what's coming, wasting our time in case the topic is not interesting to you. Even if it is interesting, you many not have time to go through all that story-built-up or flamboyance (all-that-jazz) to get the core idea. One pager Summary gives much desired quick and concise overview. Just a text summary can be boring, so adding fun-pictures helps retention and interest.

One caution though, as always a quote from Einstein: Make things simple but not simpler!! Try not to have very art-y, too much colorful, cluttered-spaghetti sketchnote, but clean sparingly arty and a bit colorful with a clear path or structure to read.

## Process
- Go through source, take text notes
- Capture ideas, core concepts, quotes
- Add sketches, containers, arrows, colors.
- Portrait mode like info-graphics, colorful
- Authors' cartoons at top and my email below
- Scan, upload to github, get permlink for addition to video comments
- LinkedIn article w my witty title, nature pixabay, explanations, scan and refs
- Share it as a LinkedIn post with hashtags, @ handles for refs & source authors

Although extremely convenient for editing, storing and sharing, avoiding digital sketchnotes for now. So no Ipad Pro with an Apple pen. Wish to keep it analog.

## Basics
- Tools: Pen/Pencils and paper/notebook
- Visual vocabulary: stick figures, letterings, faces, nature, buildings, things, flowcharts, graphs, 2d/3d, connectors, containers and layout.

## Levels

| Levels | Rough | Fair  | Comment              |
|--------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| 1      | Paper | Paper | Correct in Fair      |
| 2      | Paper | iPad  | Correct/Edit in Fair |
| 3      | -     | iPad  | Edit in Fair         |
| 4      | -     | Paper | Cant edit/correct    |

	- Why make Visual Notes? 
		- Drawing is decision making, what to keep, modify, remove. Need clarify and understanding of the topic
		- For students, a structural mapping hierarchies, retention tool
		- Involves different senses and faculties of brain
	- Commandments of drawing
		- Save Money: any paper, any pen, or finger in beach sand!! If $$$, then iPad + Pro-Create. Its not pen, but thinking
		- Concentrate: listen, understand then you can decide what to keep and symbolize
		- Embrace your imperfections, they are your signature. "Style is the difference between a circle and the way you draw it. –Pablo Picasso"
		- Work like an Egyptian: No 3D, no perspective, but just plain flat. Draw less, keep simple.
		- Commit to the mark: bold, not hairy lines. Clarity and Confidence.
		
<!-- ## Musings: Why Sketch-noting for Part II 
I was searching for a good skill, a vocation to learn that will help me sail through Part II of my life. Every week, after going through bing watching of YouTube videos or listening to multiple podcasts. It will give some ideas like Explainable AI, 3d1b like videos etc try to fit them in my two gateways of selections ie IKIGAI and Sketchnotes. At times somehow force them into those ideas and then do some reading exercises. Will typically have github directory and reference in it. All that will go o for a few days and then fizzle out or will get some new idea to move forward. This has been going on for a year now. Some areas like genetics, BioNLP needed a lot more preparation on the unknown domain to gain enough expertize to be a viable career option in Part II. Latest of the lot is Sketchnotes. There is noting new to be learnt here.  I have been sketching for years and I have been teaching CAD and ML for years and I have been preparing training material for years. I do have a Publications folder which has notes of books in 3 column an presentation modes. So the skills are/were already there. Whats new is the combination which is rare. Technical prowess at AI ML or Technology in general plus artistic inclination is a n unique combination, combined that with decent understanding and ability to make concise witty summaries can be done in sketchnotes. This is really rare. Mike Rohde, DOug Neil and Tanmay Vora are good at sketching but may lag behind on technology front. Margaret is ML + Art but her sketchnotes are less of a sketch. So if I emerge well it can be good expertize to build and pursue. I can start going through only long form, seemingly lengthy content which people just don't have time to go through. Say, 1-2-3 hours Lex Fridman talk or Seen Unseen 4 hours podcast. No one has time and patience. What I bring to table is a concise and precise summary along with visual elements which are completely missing from podcasts for sure as well as video internals to an extent. People can go through the 1 pager summaries either to learn the understand the optic quickly, keep them as reference but can also in turn as a filter even to decide whether to listen to that long form or not. This being a summary and not lifting of the content as s, the copyright law should be ok with it.Anyways I will be putting a big title and original author or interviewees in place to about missing attribution.For preparation I will need to go through the podcast or video thoroughly make text as well as rough doodle notes first and then arrange them in a portrait mode with column or rows or radial layout. I do not wish to make it cluttered or just colorful or utterly useless or unreadable content. It can be airy, sparse but has to be readable at first sight. More emphasis on the content, text firs and later replace text with symbol or icons to make it funny. I don't wish to add doodles juts for sake of it. Even colors need to be used sparingly to highlight borders and to accentuate the highlights. I will remain analog as much as possible. Going digital is better for editing, storing and sharing but at-least for this year its both rough and fair analog but later if I get (or buy) iPad Pro with Apple Pen (50th Birthday) then I will move the fair part to iPad. First part,ie the rough part will always remain on paper. This may may change if the task is to do love talks Sketchnotes but then thats the final level of expertize where directly the fair version is done either on paper (ie stand paper) or on iPad. There is a long way for that kind of expertize. I will research topic to be AI related to prepare then niche per say but later based on the demand I may dilute topics to be technical in general but also non technical such as books articles or summary reviews. Depends on demand fully.Out of 3 Freedom, Fame and Fortune this sketch-noting can surely give freedom and fame but whether money will come or not depends on the success and global recognition.. At this point there is no conflict of interest also. I can safely build this hobby and explain the difficult topics to masses. Thats what a teacher of crystallized intelligence has to do after 50. I think I have found my mojo well.
