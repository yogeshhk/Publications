## Content to summarize
but so yoganidra as a
topic is very fascinating and
like how each and every process has been brought out of the closet by the great
adapts whom we call siddhas and great yogis
these processes are there right from time immemorial
and many of you would have seen Lord mahavishnu reclining on a serpent
with half closed and half open eyes and the tradition says he contacts this
entire operation of sustenance from the state of yoganindra
so that is how ancient this particular topic is
the second reference we have is from another great text called Devi Mahatma
it's all 700 verses on couplets on the
Divine as mother Durga there too we have a mention of Yoga
Nidra so this is a very very ancient at least the word is very ancient
but the technique was hidden from the public for many eons
and in the 1970s it was released to Common
public so how this process happens
is if you notice now particularly from the year 2014-15 there
is a sudden craze to know more about yoga as a system
for the last 100 years people were studying yoga mainly as Asana that is
posture so when someone tells I am studying yoga or I just came back from a yoga class we
clearly understood they practiced some postures and then gradually now if you see in the
West the pranayama techniques are being rebranded as breath work and so many
names are going floating around correct and in 70s
Swami Rama of the Himalayan tradition and Swami satyananda
deemed it right to bring this ancient process to the public domain
in 1948 Swami satyananda's teacher Guru Swami
shivananda Saraswati realized that there needs to be a systematic study of yoga
as a system and then in 1948 he started yoga vedanta Forest Academy
there even today the two-month courses offered free for Indian citizens and
they are continuing the tradition of offering what was started by Swami
shivananda and Swami satyananda is a direct disciple of Swami shivananda
and he started not only yoga teacher training from the 1970s he also brought
in and initiated lot of women into the sannyasa which was done very rarely till
that time so Swami shivananda and him based on the need of the time they
brought in certain Traditions rituals and processes and they said time is right for people
to do this they perhaps found that world is going through is going to have a crisis during
transformation like all of us have for example if you most of us have
worked in corporate if you ever attend a program on emotional resilience Stress Management
they will say that when you are going through a big change in life it could be
marriage or divorce it would be loss of job or starting of a job
any major change brings within stress because it is an unknown competent
people will learn will need to learn how to manage that and Swami satyananda realized and Swami
Rama also realized world would go through a lot of uncertainty for example earlier when you book a
telephone in India when I was a child or a two-wheeler I am sure many of you can
relate you have to wait sometimes for 10 years to take delivery it was not easy
to get a landline connection today everyone has multiple phone connections correct so when people were used to a
very slow paced life stress was something very very unheard of unless they created
it for themselves today we are bombarded with many things from all possible
directions eight plus two ten directions we say in Tradition but I also have included one
more which is your mind which is the eleventh one so from 11 directions we are bombarded with stress and many of
them are unfound but whom you will go and say many times
you are left to fend alone correct because in olden days small homes many people live you could catch
up with anybody to unload you whatever you are thinking today huge homes rarely people live only weekends people are
there correct so the system is going through a big change so what the great
ones do generally is they release certain processes which are very very
needed for the time and age we live in and they also withdraw some processes it
is not only they keep releasing certain things they will also take back certain things which are not needed it's like
you're moderating whatever is available so in 1971
Swami Rama through his disciples was tested for this process
at the meninger foundation in the U.S using electroencephalogram EEG today we
know that the wires are you know connected to the brain and they map the brain studies
wherein we have five types of waves generated in
the brain and when you are in deep Sleep Delta
wave is generated and when you are not particularly
focusing on anything like you are just on the seashore you
know you are just there if someone tests you you will see alpha
waves are being generated by your name when nothing particular you are anchoring behind or pounding upon mind
naturally releases alpha waves and if you notice last 20 years this
Alpha Waves meditation has become a very big craze in between Alpha and
Delta is the theta waves they are also fantastic and they are produced when the
mind is in the meditative State okay now when you are having a day-to-day work
the beta and gamma waves they are generated a lot gamma waves is as good
as cacophony like you are in a Bombay local any of you would have experienced
how noisy it is or you go to the market on a weekend or a Friday Market
you know something is going on but more only sound is there so gamma is when
your brain is pounded with lot of things gamma happens
and in yoga we have used that also like you know life can have can be utilized
in both the ways correct to protect yourself and also do whatever is not
required as well like that gamma waves using yoga processes you can turn it to
your advantage and beta waves is when we are most of us
are constantly there if we don't check we will be only overthinking in life
and many of you may be knowing this word alphabet has come from Alpha and beta
so Alpha Beta Gamma Delta and Theta that is how the sequence there are right the
so what Swami Rama demonstrated was in deep state which is Delta generally
there is no rapid eye movement when you and I sleep generally there is movement
of the eyes so the dreams happen imaginations you don't know whether
you're half sleep or half awake that's all happening because of rapid eye movement technically we call it REM
but in Delta that it is called a non REM State
wherein it signifies you are having a very very deep sleep
the beauty is yoganidra can take us to Delta which is very deep sleep and all
of us know a deep sleep gives us relaxation right only that can give relaxation if you
keep getting up in the night many times there is no relaxation correct
the beauty is proper Nidra is Delta in Yoga Nidra you
continue to be in Delta but you are awake this is a technical way through
Neuroscience you can understand Yoga Nidra is we take the mind systematically
to the Delta wave in that pattern in the brain after the five waves yet you are not asleep
so when someone practices Yoga Nidra at this level which actually we take people
at the level four Yoga Nidra when people are practicing level four Yoga Nidra to
the letter t the delta waves begin to work why I am
approaching this topic one of the questions raised for us is can we work
with subconscious mind using yoganidra when can you work with subconscious mind
is when you are either in alpha or in this Delta
okay so there is a possibility of you exploring the subconscious mind and
habits and patterns change else you may be practicing yoga nindra
for 20 years nothing will happen as our alumni knows it's not about the
length of time you practice it is how consistent and with intention and how
deep your practices so this is the background of Yogananda now what happened is Swami Rama was able
to recall everything what was being spoken in the lab while his brain was
emitting Delta that is what astonished the scientists in the year 1971.
his disciples Swami Veda bharati went one step ahead
maybe they didn't measure Swami Rama
his mind was in Delta and Theta he was conversing like how we are
conversing that means by practice you can manage to
I you don't want to use the word dictate you manage to regulate the way your
brain has to function okay so this is very very important
thing to know now this is the lab side approach of
Yoga Nidra now what Swami satyananda did was he trained a disciple in multiple
languages and multiple knowledge while the disciple was not even a teenager the disciple was made to sleep
in the room where Swami satyananda was taking classes to the disciples
so here comes the Deep Impact of Yoga Nidra
so what is the lesson we get here is it's a very subtle lesson is till our
mind is not developing the I me myself that
ego identification of an individualization identification our
mind is always like a sponge open to learnings you can take it
so what are we trying to do we are trying to come away from all the sheets
or the coats or the coverings what we put for ourselves so that we become once
again a child and if you noticed many of you may be living in an
apartment complexes or your children may be studying in in schools where
the children speak multiple languages nobody teaches them they pick up the
language have you observed that so this is how they pick up through the
sounds okay because their mind is not into too
much changing the mind of a child lives in the present moment
so in yoga what we do we gradually train people to take their mind to the present
moment because in the present there is no future
what you do in the present creates your future and even you meditate on your past it's
going to be trouble some in the now okay so this moment of now Yoga Nidra
practice can create which we read in books and listen in podcasts see we need to understand something
intellectually today things are available in Google discussions books so many so much
material is available but how to bring it to life we need to go to the tradition or a
teacher who can help us to sift through the heaps of information and take only
what you need correct what everybody knows I need to relax how to relax nobody knows
because people think they go to vacation they relax they come back more tired from vacation right
this is what happens generally okay so now I was addressing these these type of
questions were there before we started the session okay any observations till
now any questions till now
okay so can I move to the next okay now I was telling you about
not just we need to know what has to be done how to do it
the title of this podcast itself is Inspire someone today right
what has to what we have to do we have to inspire but what the conceptualizer
of this entire team srikanth did he said how this is how you do it
you understand these very basic things success comes when what and how is married
so what we are going to do using Yoga Nidra technique is we need to get into understanding of how the body relaxes
and we also practice and experience how it relaxes okay so for this purpose
we also need to understand One More Concept from our tradition which is called the panchakosha means five sheets
panchay is she any knowledge or any change in any human
being is possible only when whatever we are practicing
touches on these five Shields if you only intellectually satisfy
someone it's not going to change if you are only going to convince
somebody it's not going to change if you are only going to emotionally connect it's not going to change if you only do
physically like Asana nothing is going to change you are getting it you need to integrate
all these things and work as a system so what we do in Yogananda is we tap
the little man in the brain so you have a
you have an area in your brain which is called little man it is like a child
cuddled inside a mother's womb that is how the blueprint is there in our brain each of us have that
when you reach that out your physical level relaxation immediately starts
your understanding then in the next level yogendra we take people to the
joints and the breath your joints also has a breath is naturally having piranha
okay so that is handled then through the resolve the mind is handled
whenever you do a level three onwards Yoga Nidra it gives more benefit and it
makes sense when you practice with a resolve because each of us have stress because of something which you are
afraid you will not achieve please correct me if I am wrong
that is the reason why we have stress right so today we started
for a second we lost connection so srikan came back and asked right are
we connected are we doing it you you got it so the entire effort
till it ends that is going to be stress but how are we going to manage it by
only giving our best correct so this stress what is the cause
of anybody's stress is one thought which we know commonly as a desire
if the desire we understand how to handle you will understand how to handle stress
why it is important we will die without stress people have
to understand this people think they are dying due to stress that is secondary
if you don't have stress you will have boredom in life
and you will not know what to do you will invite all lifestyle diseases to yourself
this is a very important point please invite stress
because you learn how to manage it without stress there is no growth
with stress the egg breaks right chicken is there it's stress only a child is
born with stress the pupa becomes a butterfly without stress of deadline sometimes
things never get achieved today they speak about smart goals no
smart measurable unless there is a goal and there is a
basic manageable stress nothing will get done in life
we have to understand so if you are wanting to have a stress-free life only a dead body or a realize the soul can
have it because one is unaware and another is completely aware all of us
are walking towards that both of it but
definitely death is there whether we realize or not that is we don't know at least this life our next life but we are
all in between right so we will have our own degrees of stress
and with this knowledge only you should get into the practice of Yoga Nidra we
cannot just download a script or an audio or start listening to it without having this background
and nothing is a foolproof unless you change your lifestyle so when
you do Yoga Nidra completely as a module you will understand how to adjust and
change and adapt the lifestyle so that the Yoga Nidra process gives you Amplified benefits okay so we begin with
the little man in the brain and then with the breath you are countering the mind because when you have anxious
thoughts there is shallow breathing we cannot directly manage thoughts
because all our thoughts are waiting to be scratched they are only tip of the iceberg moment you try to counter them
they will give you one more point which you will be scratching your head or you will be shouting at the top of the voice
to your spouse or your children they don't know why you are shouting because when you meddle with your mind without
understanding it's a problem so what happens the breath and the mind
or the sides of the same coin so when they are arranged in the upanishad the koshas the sheets they have arranged the
physical first second is The Prana then the mind so what is the understanding we
have the the breath which is technically called Prana when it deepens it directly
impacts your brain waves quietening it so this is how we have to study anything
systematically and then using your intellect you narrow down which desires
are there there are various methods we share through which they can shortlist and filter the desires
and then the practice of yoginidra takes a complete shape now
should someone wait to learn completely to experience relaxation not necessary
when they Faithfully practice the level one or level two yogan Indra which today
we would be practicing the level through yoganidra Seated on a chair
okay because you don't need to have a yoga mat go in search of it if you are
not having don't worry sit on a chair with back straight and just go through the instructions
and this is very easy to practice every day why it is very easy
your best friend is you your worst enemy is you and if your appointment of the
day with you is good the entire day you can manage anything which comes down
so we should think of Yoga Nidra as an appointment we have with ourselves before we are going to get into the very
hectic day we are not talking about people who need Yoga Nidra because they are insomniacs
that's a different subject altogether we are not going to use Yoga Nidra to achieve Nidra but we are going to use
Yoga Nidra to achieve awareness and do better and clear in life
okay so I'm not treating any of you as a patient here we are all here to learn
something to improve our life and lifestyle Okay so people think meditation is important it
is extremely important but we should know how to meditate correct and Yoga Nidra is a stepping stone to clear
meditation so we need to prepare well so what we do when we we share yoga as a
system Yoga Nidra is kept as the first limb of yoga medication is kept as the
seventh limb of yoga
so when you go through three four five six is concentration which naturally
develops which will lead you to meditation so in short if you dump directly to meditation you will get up more stressed
so today the key area is stress how to bring it down now
how many of you have experienced Frozen shoulders or neck pain or low
back pain correct this is basically stress
building up and hitting first the weakest part in your body second that's a systematic study which
says if your Alpha is affected what is the reason psychological reason because
everything is psychosomatic if your shoulders are heavy what could be the reason
when you are carrying more than you can you'll have cervical and you have
shoulder issues sometimes you are imagining you are carrying more that time also you will have probably
sometimes genuinely it is then you take the entire load of the family sometimes imagination also leads to that
what happens L why I'm speaking today we are seated on a chair no so I call this
office chairs are all recipes for disaster they're the moving chairs nobody will
have a steady mind with moving chairs so this L5 what happens when stress gets
accumulated you want to prove or continuously or doing something nobody is giving attention or there is a fear
of failure your L5 will start becoming a problem people think sitting and working
for long hours in office is creating low back problem that is the physical side the mental side is fear of
non-acceptance and fear of failure all these things we can iron out using Yogananda
like every day we get update but brush our teeth have breakfast similarly when
you do everyday Yoga Nidra it is your mental and physical housekeeping it keeps you fresh in the mind and the body
does that make sense okay so the little man in the brain
helps you to consciously relax in the body level working with the breath during yoganidra
helps as a precursor to calm down your mind so in today we can only do up to
this level to uh in today's podcast any questions till now
any area should I address foreign
but if your routine is not allowing when you come back from your work
before even engaging with someone because that generally causes eruption for us and others disturbance you can do
a basic 12 to 15 minute Yoga Nidra calm down have a cup of water or tea then talk with people it's so it depends on
our need but if you are doing yoginudra for indoor exploration self-discovery deep meditative
experiences nothing to do with transactional life I would suggest do it in the morning before you even start the
day but if you are a person who is already having a very high demand job or high
demanding family we don't know right many of us get into family not knowing how demanding it is office is equally
demanding so you practice first yoginidra as a first aid before you
start interacting with the people it is for people at home we work right and there is no fund when we come and be
erupt and there is another volcano waiting to erupt so we just come home relax
12 to 15 minutes we practice this consciously then go back to the home which is the world for which we work
so it depends on that third a third place how you can do this is once you understand this concept you
can walk into your meeting room five to six minutes before you can sit quiet and
do the scanning of the body as per whatever you are learning
something is better than nothing right so you are becoming well prepared to
even attend a meeting so these are the ways in which based on our need we can
deploy yoganathram and for people who are having stress without knowing why
they don't know why they are going towards a goal they have to invest time energy and learn till level four or
level seven to begin with till level four and then they will stop they'll be taught how to reduce
prioritize and then take up one desire at a time and Seed it as a result in
yoginidra to start seeing their desires come true so whoever you uh who are here all of
them have seen at least one desire come true in their life organically it's not magic it is how yoganidra works and that
is the reason some of them are attending today after seven years of completing the program so that is
personal experience in many of them who have undergone this program okay does
that answer your question yeah okay so now
um before we proceed further I wanted to give clarification on couple of terms
which you will be hearing okay one word you will be hearing is
be aware I am not telling beware be aware
okay whenever this word aware you hear the word aware
you don't try to focus don't try to
concentrate so what is the easiest way try to maintain a smiling five face throughout
the practice when you have a smiling face your mind tends to automatically stay in the
present moment okay this is very very important
so how to differentiate awareness and focus in Awareness it is effortless
in concentration and focus there is an effort I'll give you one more example
how many of you are hearing some sounds in your room
yeah so you can say I am aware of those songs
so at home when there is a discussion happening one of us tell the word yeah I
am aware that's happening but I don't want to focus on it now
particularly when you are dealing with teenage children I'm just telling you a practical thing
right so what we use the word I am aware of what's going on but I am not going to focus on that thing right now like that
when you sit in a place a vehicle may pass the fan may give you some sound the air
condition May once in a while make a heavy sound if you are using a world window air conditioner
while you are about to prepare for Yoga Nidra somebody will ring the bell or someone will increase the TV volume so
what is happening you are aware of all that is happening the second key is in a non-reactionary
mode that is called awareness yeah I am aware of it and you should not
take off on the person after your yoginudra class you cannot go and tell them do you really have sins I already
told you I am practicing yoginitra if you ever use these statements you are not ready for yogendra
because the world will function the way it functions we need to optimize the way
we live within ourselves when people see the change they will
change unless that till that time you have to just be aware of whatever is
happening it helps you to develop a non-reactionary mode which we call it as
a responsive noun so when you are going to hear the word awareness you are just going to be aware why I am
saying this I would be saying be aware of the right shoulder so with close guys the tendency is to
try and beep or look into your right shoulder don't do that let your eyes be very calm
quiet and still deal your eyes like how you deal with rose petal
don't crush them don't torture them just internally through the mind your eyes
are still and then you are directly looking at the right shoulder why when
you do this you are preparing for a deep delta waves in Delta wave there is no
rapid eye movement please go back to the first two three minutes of this podcast
non-rapid eye movement Delta wave is the Neuroscience based scientific goal for
Yogananda and what that does mean is deep relaxation and awareness in the
Practical level so when we are not training ourselves to
keep the eyes still we will not be in a mindset to practice a non-rem that means
we will never allow our brain to rest only when the brain rests it becomes
prepared and it goes to a deeper state okay so what I will recap when you hear
the word awareness please know that it is not focus
it is hazy but yours you know something is going on you are there and that that
is also happening then correct second when you are aware deep
within tell whatever is happening is happening for a reason I am only going to respond
I am not going to react I'm only going to respond better not to use the word I
am not going to react you use the word I will only respond to people and situations I am just practicing
awareness is that okay now once in a while if you slip into
sleep don't worry it may happen
it's quite natural the moment you are aware you have dozed off come back and continue listening to
the instruction and go with the instruction that is the second point is that clear
now the third point to get the maximum benefit never try to assess
what the instructor is going to say next
that is not your job your job is to practice
instruction is from the instructor it is their headache don't think for somebody
you'll be more stressed the word session itself is reducing the stress why you
want to think because our alumni knows in deeper yoga you will skip some body parts
if you are a finicky with perfection or you have a obsessive compulsive disorder
you will get up from yoginidra more stressed than before so remember your role is a practitioner
you are not an examiner there or you are not a magician trying to predict what
the teacher is going to tell next okay is that all fine
if if any questions are there it's okay you can ask else we will do a short
12 to 14 minute yoga instructor yes
thanks shrika is it fine
okay how many of you are having a comfortable chair to sit
when I say comfortable chair both The Souls of the feet should firmly rest on
the carpet if you are wearing a house Chapel please wear it because we need a non-conductor
below your soul if you are seated on a carpet so be it yes I know
even it out absolutely
sit in a posture where your spine can be erect if you're finding it too much switch off
the video lie down no problem okay so I'll just give you 15-20 seconds
to prepare
I will be opening the eyes because I can practice with open eyes
and I also have to check whether the internet connection is there so for that purpose I will keep my eyes
open you don't need to open your eyes and see what's going on because you are in your
own home it is a safe place mentally tell yourself you are in a safe place
so that you will not open your eyes okay and if if you want to go off video
please feel free if you want to be on video also no problem
now gently close your eyes those of you who are seated
the instructions are for you open out your chest
relax your elbows Place The Palms facing the roof on your
thighs the souls firmly on the ground
those of you who are seated in meditative posture you know what to do
the third category of people who wish to lie down and practice
ensure the heels are facing each other
and they are at least one and a half to two feet away
that helps your lower back to relax better
now allow the hands to be slightly away from the body
with the Palms facing the roof
this position helps your neck to relax
you can adjust your neck shoulders if you are lying down
and feel rest completely
remember this is a precursor to meditation and Swami satyananda says Yoga Nidra is
the first step towards Transcendence so it's a very very important process
like the Chinese philosopher lord said the journey every step is very important
and the Journey Begins With the first step so Yoga Nidra you can safely consider as the first step towards
self-discovery
let the eyes be gently closed
have a smile on your face consciously
when you see a sunrise or a blossoming flag you feel so relaxed and smiling right
all that smile
once you are steady in the posture rotate your awareness on all directions
and just observe the sounds around you
you are seated in nature if it is daytime for you you could hear
chirping of birds Vehicles passing by
The Sounds around you depend on where you are and the time of the day
with a smiling face just go from one sound to the other
sound and be aware
when we practice awareness of sounds it helps us directly to increase silence
in our mind
now shift the awareness from the sounds
to your body
the body is Comfortably lying down or seated
and as and when you hear a part of the body keeping your eyes still and smile intact
let me say once again keep your eyes still and smile intact
just take your awareness to the body part which would be
mentioned one after the other

be aware of the nape of the neck
top of your head
the forehead
eyebrows
eyes ears
nose cheeks
lips chin
neck chest
abdomen and run the awareness from the pelvic
region to your toes
now you're completely aware of your body which is still and steady
with that state of steadiness be aware of the breaths
just be a witness of the breathing process
which anyway happens whether we are aware or unaware
let's not make a conscious effort to breathe deep
but just with the smiling face observe the breaths
foreign
travel elsewhere get the Mind back to the breaths
continue being aware of the breath with a smiling face and steady posture
now from the breath bring your awareness to the body
mentally observe how you are seated or lying down
still and steady
now become aware of the sounds around you
man-made Vehicles music
Birds it could be anything just with a smiling face be aware
now those of you who are seated and giving the instructions for closure
those of you who are lying down be there those of you who are sitting you can rub
your palms vigorously to generate some heat
and place the Palms on the eyelids to transfer the warm sensation
once again calming press the Palms against the ears and the
cheeks
the last time palming place it at the nape of the neck
and the back low back
and hold the Palms like a book how you would read a book before you
and with a few blings gaze into the Palms and stay still
and Silent till further instructions now those of you who are lying down
get your legs together interlock your fingers
take the hands above the head in line with the floor
and as you inhale stretch yourself as if someone is stretching your spine
and as you exhale relax
now bend your left leg place the left palm on the abdomen
turn to the right straighten the legs
place the left palm before your chest on the ground
keeping the eyes closed with the help of the hands gently come up to a seated
position
and do practice spamming for your eyes alone is enough
vigorously rub your palms once enough heat is generated place it
on the eyelids transfer the warm sensation
hold the hands before you like how you would read a book
with a few blings look into your palms familiarize your eyes with the light
around you
and you feel to come on camera you can
we request the practitioners generally to keep a Silence of two to five minutes
depending on the duration of the practice minimum two minutes works
wonders technically the session is over for today
shrika has any observations or any areas which we could address you can tell
