Notes:
- Theme: Avoiding Distractions due to Technology
- Adam Gazzaley, neuroscientist working on neuroplasticity and tools for improvements of cognitive abilities
- Multitasking: we like and good at doing multiple things, but should not be parallel-processing. 
- Listening to music and another reflexive action like driving seems ok, but if there is something odd that happens, then switching the attention to that event becomes challenging and could be detrimental.
- Bottom up attention: limited brain resources are drawn, by environment, like big sound.
- Top down attention: Goal oriented. Intentional.
- Constantly managing, both types. Switching costs to get the earlier context.
- Technology is designed to seek your attention. Each tab, gives you new information tree, and there are many of them, easy to switch. Frictionless.
- Single tasking - challenging to start with but enjoyable later, like long distance running.
- Digital Medicine: challenge brain targets for permanent/plastic change. Meditation is one.Video games multi modal sensing and then feeding back in to developing challenges.
- Future of Technology: chip in body for extreme cases.

[Personal: Planning to pursue single-tasking in 2 hrs slots]
