Notes:
- Theme: Meditation
- Steven Laureys, a practicing neurologist working on damaged brains, surgeries under hypnosis.
- Meditation: subject-object duality is an illusion. At one point, the meditator and the topic of meditation dissolves into one. No control, just happens.
- There is nothing watching, no `self' in head. Although you may start with watching breath, but the state comes when mindfulness has no subject.
- Meditation: doing less, less distractions, stepping out of the treadmill.
- Due to realizations via mediation, you already are happy/content and then you put that in relationships, social connectedness and not the other way round.
- Meditation cuts the idea that you are 'thinking'. There is no Free will.
- Free Will: You don't have control on what thought will come next. You feel you are directing the movie, but the direction itself is part of the movie.
- Resolve the fallacy by doing both simultaneously ie have a good life, do work, achieve things, at the same time recognize that its just happening on its own [but practically in life, you are held responsible for what you do].
- Science is ground truth for even spiritual practices. Paying attention certain ways only causes meditation.

[Personal: Breath (pranayam) is the bridge from physical to mental. Controlling breath can control mind, relax it. Focusing on breath (dharana) can help get into meditative state (dhyan)]
