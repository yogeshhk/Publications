Jottings:
- Theme: Physics
- Achievement: With mathematics, humans can decipher physical phenomena with utmost accuracy.
- There is nothing special about earth. We haven't explored the universe at all.
- Science vs Religion: are there very obvious issues where religion just cannot deliver (e.g. environment degradation, nuclear war, etc)
- String theory: substantial progress but not enough, not good enough for testing. So can not outright disregard it!!
- Quantum mechanics: Newton (you can predict using current state) but QM said that the prediction has to be probabilistic. Multi universe is illusion of the same universe. [Heisenberg principal]. Attempts to answer Quantum measurements.
- Time: Einstein (Relativity): Clocks do not move at same pace if they move at different speeds. Even gravity affects passage of time. String Theory says Space-Time may have emerged from some more fundamental entities.
