Jottings:
- Theme: Rationality
- Truth was important earlier (where lion is?!!), but now more important as it used as a political weapon in distorted form.
- Example: Homeopathy. The premise that "very diluted disease-causing-substance cures the disease" is not at par with evidence-based other types.
- Meaning of life: 'Propagation of selfish genes', or you decide for yourself.
- Book "Greatest show on earth': evidence of evolution. Why Darwin was right.
