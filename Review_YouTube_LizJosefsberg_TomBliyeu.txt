Jottings:
- Theme: Weight Loss (mostly mental ways)
- We know whats good, but we don't act consistently
- Even if you don't achieve target perfectly, thats ok, even nearby it is ok.
- Guilt about not following diet, triggers reward in brain!! gamblers gamble more when loosing.
- Move bad triggers away from sight. Refuse excuses. Repetition builds habit.
- We overeat due to stress. Meditate. 
- Practice gratitude. 
- Eating is inherently attractive [evolutionarily].
- Push urge to quit. Exercise mind. Take baby steps. Keep promises to yourself.
- Make designated meal plans, for breakfast, lunch, dinner. Easy to make.
- 6 Pillars for Wt loss: 
	- diet/carbs < 100g, 
	- exercise > 100 minutes a week, 
	- movement > 100 minutes a week, 
	- stress relieving > 100 minutes a week, 
	- water (one imp change)
	- sleep 
- Tech/Wearables: use mobile to count steps >  10k-12k, track sleep but not food.
