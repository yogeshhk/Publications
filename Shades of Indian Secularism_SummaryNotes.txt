- The choice between cultural nationalism and constitutional secularism confuses a many. These are not some fringe comments or book excerpts but laws/practices followed officially by govt/emeinent people
- Gods: Ram and Krishna birthdays are not compulsory central govt holidays, but Mohammad and Jesus, are throughout India.
- Temples Management:  Control funds, appoint nominee on Hindu temples but not on mosques or churches
- Sharia laws: No Uniform civil code. Muslim males - 4 wives at a time, can divorce them by triple ‘Talaaq’ thrice, in compliance with Sharia.
-  Signs of slavery: Kashi, Ayodhya and Mathura, not fully restored. Hindu genocides - Aurangabad city name. Tipu’s birthday. 
- Biased history: NCERT - a chapter each from Akbar to Aurangzeb, but Shivaji and Maharana Pratap are squeezed into a paragraph each.
- Temples: ASI Survey of India 1924-25 - 64 page long district-wise list of Islamic monuments which were constructed by demolishing Hindu temples. Kashmir, hundreds of temples, in early 90s.
- Violating the sanctity: Ram Mandir to Ram Setu and to Bhagwad Geeta,  into Indian courts. the central government filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court suggesting that Ram never existed. And others’ gods?
- Minority schemes: Do major Yatra’s get subsidy as Haj? Some state govts have reservations.
- Terrorist Support: afzalguru.org, petition for Yakub. No support for Sadhvi Pragya, and Swami Aseemanand even though no FIR filed against them
