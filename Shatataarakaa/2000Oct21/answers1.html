<b>Q1.</b> As this is the first song, we would like to start with one picturised on a God. Both the lyricist and the music director have many love songs to their credit but this is a relatively rare case when they have come together in one song.
<br><br>

The hero is actually a man, but God's incarnation. Though Him and the heroine have heard of each other, they have never met. Here, the heroine has caught sight of him and is stealing glances.
