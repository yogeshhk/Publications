<h3>Thank you for visiting!</h3>

<b>Aim</b>: To make people more aware, interested and respectful of
marathi music and artistes. 

<br><br>
Working on "shatataarakaa" is a great hobby. It involves buying
records or collecting songs from friends and listening to songs available on
the internet. Also, gathering information about albums, movies, artistes and
anecdotes behind them. Then put to use all the time, information and
resources you have towards the aim above!

<ul>
<pre>
<li><b>Who</b>: We are looking for people to help improve 
"shatataarakaa", with the above aim in mind. If you like to listen to
marathi music you are a valuable resource for us! 

<li><b>What</b>: You will be required to suggest ideas and work on regular
tasks too. We are very open minded about any new idea, and will probably
ask you to work on it yourself!

<li>As of now it will not require a lot of time contribution (an hour
per week - excluding email) but the future may see you spend more of your
time on it. How much time you spend is completely upto you.
