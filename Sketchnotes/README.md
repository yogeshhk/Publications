# Sketchnotes, Visual Summary (नवनीत दर्शन, भावार्थ दीपिका, सारचित्र )

Sketchnote is an abstraction, figuring out whats important and then mapping to appropriate symbolism, as a gist in a single page.

It is a one-page visual format that simplifies complex ideas, difficult concepts, threads, books, newsletter, podcast, YT video, and other long form content to make it faster and easier to consume.


Latest indulgence: Visual Summaries: Sketchnotes: One page summary, effective for audio (podcasts) and linear mediums like videos. At times good for random access mediums like articles or books also.

More on, specifically, sketchnotes below, as it is IKIGAI, Specific Knowledge and USP for me, especially due to ChatGPT sketchnotes (Has about 1.8 million impressions/views)

## Why Sketchnotes? 

What problem are you solving? Purpose?

- Information overload
- Less time & attention
- Need ready & fun gist

So, 3 Ss: Simplify, Subtract & Summarize

नवनीत: eternally-new/butter(summary-सार, भावार्थ, अमृत)
दर्शन: sight, enlightened visual manifestation (दीपिका)

Podcasts (or videos or talks and to an extent even books or blogs) are black-boxes. You don't get anything unless you go through them fully. There is no preview-trailer of what's coming, wasting our time in case the topic is not interesting to you. Even if it is interesting, you many not have time to go through all that story-built-up or flamboyance (all-that-jazz) to get the core idea. One pager Summary gives much desired quick and concise overview. Just a text summary can be boring, so adding fun-pictures helps retention and interest.

One caution though, as always a quote from Einstein: Make things simple but not simpler!! Try not to have very art-y, too much colorful, cluttered-spaghetti sketchnote, but clean sparingly arty and a bit colorful with a clear path or structure to read.

	- Why make Visual Notes? 
		- Drawing is decision making, what to keep, modify, remove. Need clarify and understanding of the topic
		- For students, a structural mapping hierarchies, retention tool
		- Involves different senses and faculties of brain
	- Commandments of drawing
		- Save Money: any paper, any pen, or finger in beach sand!! If $$$, then iPad + Pro-Create. Its not pen, but thinking
		- Concentrate: listen, understand then you can decide what to keep and symbolize
		- Embrace your imperfections, they are your signature. "Style is the difference between a circle and the way you draw it. –Pablo Picasso"
		- Work like an Egyptian: No 3D, no perspective, but just plain flat. Draw less, keep simple.
		- Commit to the mark: bold, not hairy lines. Clarity and Confidence.
