# Doodles-as-A-Service Repo

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

üëã Aloha, this is where you can grab most of my tech doodles and sketchnotes.

I have been posting my tech doodles on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac) and [Microsoft open-source projects](https://github.com/microsoft/). I am repeatedly asked where to get the original images, especially from people who saw some of my works out of context on some social media, so I decided to put them all together on one GitHub repo.

Here are some of the latest digitally created hand-drawn doodles, as well as photos of analog ones.

All my doodles are under Creative a Commons license, so please share with attributions. And I definitely don't want you to NFT them without my permission (and I won't permit you because you don't own them. They are open-sourced to be freely available for educational purpose only!)

Enjoy üå∫

## HTTP Status Cats üê±

This is one of my first personal projects to make technology into cats. Although this is *not* doodling, I thought it was worth mentioning here!

All HTTP Cats are now hosted at [HTTP.cat](https://http.cat) because the domain name is awesome.

All images (except a few) are originally created by me a decade ago! Read the story on [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/http-status-cats)

## Slack API Zine
[/slack](/slack)

```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅslack  
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ...

```

These are something I did while working at Slack. I created the zine (as physical printed books) to be distributed at Slack-sponsored events and conferences but never got fully approved. The global pandemic forced us to give up all in-person events anyway.

The content is outdated as of 2022 so view them with cautions.

## üñ® Printing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Updated on August 27, 2021: 
> 
> GitHub warned me that my Git LFS is disabled as the bandwidth exceeded  exceeded your data plan by 150%+.
> So now the high-res version in TIFF is temporary unavailable. I will move them somewhere when I have time. 
> Thank you! 
> üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

~~The *tiff* files are for printing. I set them in 5.83 x 8.27 inches, which should fit in A5 paper size.
They are large files and stored as LFS files so you won't download the actual files when you `git clone` so please download manually from GitHub.~~
