\begin{itemize}
\item Emerging Technologies take civilizations forward (most of the times)
\item Effects can be positive or negative. 
\item Anxiety when it gets introduced.
\item Shortcomings are highlighted disproportionately: even if there are 40k accidental deaths by normal cars, 1/2 by autonomous vehicle gets the front-page.
\item Important to be informed about whats coming!!

\item Technologies do not move at an uniform speed on Hype Cycle. Thats captured by color and shape of the dot. It decides time to reach Plateau of Productivity or maturity of market adoption (ie last stage, and not the time to reach PEAK).
\item 5 phases and 4 dot shapes/colors

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Over the Years by Duncan Stewart}


\begin{itemize}
\item Some technologies surpass the hype. 4G wireless networks (2010) and cloud computing (2009) are both trillion-dollar industries today. Neither really went through the classic Gartner “trough of disillusionment” and have been consistently hot trends for a decade now.

\item Some technologies follow the classic Hype Cycle almost perfectly. 3D printing (2012) was definitely over-hyped. But although the “factory in every home” hype did not ever happen enterprise 3D printing came out of the trough quite nicely, and will soon be a \$3 billion industry, growing at 12-13\% per year

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Over the Years by Duncan Stewart}


\begin{itemize}
\item Some technologies are overhyped, and never fulfill their promise. E-book readers (2009) and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device, 2012)

\item Some technologies may do well one day…but it can take an awfully long time. Podcasting was shown ascending the hype curve in the 2005 edition, and many expected it to be the Next Big Thing soon. Did not happen, but may happen. Same with Autonomous vehicles (2015).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Over the Years by Duncan Stewart}


\begin{itemize}
\item Many technologies never come out of the trough. I am not even talking about augmented reality glasses (2011). Yes, Google Glass.

\item Conclusion: You have to do your own work. The Hype Cycle is a great graphic, and a useful visualization. But it is a lousy predictor. Being at the hype peak doesn’t guarantee that a given technology will succeed massively

\begin{itemize}
\item Democratized AI, as cloud computing, open source and the "maker" community open AI to the masses.

\item Digitalized ecosystems, as companies shift from compartmentalized infrastructure to platforms that create broader ecosystems to connect humans and tech.

\item Ubiquitous infrastructure, as limitless, always available infrastructure expands business opportunity.

\item Transparently immerse spaces, as technology becomes more human-centric and creates smarter spaces.

\item Do-it-yourself biohacking, as line between what is technology and what is human blurs.

\item Algorithmic trust: to shift from trusting central authorities to trusting algorithms, Block-chain
\item Beyond silicon: Use synthetic DNA in place of silicon or quantum architectures to perform computation or store data. (still rudimentary)
\item Formative AI: adaptive ML, generative AI to create new novel content (images, video etc.) or alter existing content
\item Digital me: digital versions of ourselves, health digital twins, authentication, access and payment.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Criticism By Patrick Crouch}


\begin{itemize}
\item Personally, couldn’t find a single example of tech-oriented company using the Hype Cycle to determine spending or strategy.
\item So who’s using it? Answer: Marketers.
\item Most technological advances come from the combination or misuse of a variety of technologies, not from one technology being researched
\item The Gartner Hype Cycle is more of a scapegoat for failing/unrealized technical promise than a useful tool

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Lessons}


\begin{itemize}
\item  We're terrible at making predictions. Especially about the future. Out of 200 unique technologies that have ever appeared on a Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technology, just a handful of technologies  have been identified early and traveled even somewhat predictably through a Hype Cycle
\item An alarming number of technology trends are flashes in the pan. Just over 50 individual technologies appear for just a single year on the Hype Cycle - never to reappear again. 
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Lessons}


\begin{itemize}
\item  Lots of technologies just die. Period. 
\item The technical insight is often correct, but the implementation isn't there
\item We've been working on a few core technical problems for decades: Speech recognition, Internet micropayments
\item Some technologies keep receding into the future: Quantum Computing, Brain/Computer Interfaces
