\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Criticism By Patrick Crouch}


\begin{itemize}
\item Personally, couldn’t find a single example of tech-oriented company using the Hype Cycle to determine spending or strategy.
\item So who’s using it? Answer: Marketers.
\item Most technological advances come from the combination or misuse of a variety of technologies, not from one technology being researched
\item The Gartner Hype Cycle is more of a scapegoat for failing/unrealized technical promise than a useful tool

\end{itemize}
