%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Trends in 2018: Emerging Technologies}
\begin{itemize}
\item Democratized AI, as cloud computing, open source and the "maker" community open AI to the masses.

\item Digitalized ecosystems, as companies shift from compartmentalized infrastructure to platforms that create broader ecosystems to connect humans and tech.

\item Ubiquitous infrastructure, as limitless, always available infrastructure expands business opportunity.

\item Transparently immerse spaces, as technology becomes more human-centric and creates smarter spaces.

\item Do-it-yourself biohacking, as line between what is technology and what is human blurs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Trends in 2019: AI}
\begin{itemize}
\item Augmented intelligence: to be more efficient with automation, reduce mistakes.
\item Chatbots: The change from “the user learns the interface” to “the chatbot is learning what the user wants” 
\item Machine learning: can solve business problems, due to big data and compute
\item AI governance: creating policies to fight AI-related biases, discrimination and other negative implications of AI
\item Intelligent applications: to support or replace human-based activities via intelligent automation, data-driven insights, and guided recommendations to improve productivity and decision making.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Trends in 2020: Emerging Technologies}

Unique trends:

\begin{itemize}
\item Composite architectures: plug-and-play like Lego blocks, packaged business capabilities built on a flexible data fabric, to respond to rapidly changing business needs.
\item Algorithmic trust: to shift from trusting central authorities to trusting algorithms, Block-chain
\item Beyond silicon: Use synthetic DNA in place of silicon or quantum architectures to perform computation or store data. (still rudimentary)
\item Formative AI: adaptive ML, generative AI to create new novel content (images, video etc.) or alter existing content
\item Digital me: digital versions of ourselves, health digital twins, authentication, access and payment.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Criticism By Patrick Crouch}


\begin{itemize}
\item Personally, couldn’t find a single example of tech-oriented company using the Hype Cycle to determine spending or strategy.
\item So who’s using it? Answer: Marketers.
\item Most technological advances come from the combination or misuse of a variety of technologies, not from one technology being researched
\item The Gartner Hype Cycle is more of a scapegoat for failing/unrealized technical promise than a useful tool
