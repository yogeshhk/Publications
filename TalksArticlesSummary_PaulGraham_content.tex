\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Programming Bottom-up}

\begin{itemize}
\item Keep software units (say, functions, classes) small, else software will be hard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.
\item Top Down refactoring, upto manageable granularity
\item Lisp: Bottom up. If some basic operators are not there, they are coded first and used up later, like kernel to UI.
\item Once you abstract out the parts which are merely bookkeeping, what's left is much shorter; much desirable.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Beating the Averages}

\begin{itemize}
\item Conventional wisdom: Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.
\item If you do what average person does, the results will be? ``Average''.
\item If you're running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If not, you're in trouble.
\item  In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.
\item Programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. They're half technology and half religion. Hard to change.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Taste for Makers}

\begin{itemize}
\item Taste: Design (or appreciate) beautiful things.
\item Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it's not true. There should be universal appeal for the beauty.
\item Your old tastes were not merely different, but worse
\item Good design is simple, iss timeless
\item Good design solves the right problem, is suggestive
\item Good design is often slightly funny (not really, mostly)
\item Good design is hard (but) looks easy
\item Good design uses symmetry, resembles nature
\item Good design is redesign
\end{itemize}

[Yogesh: Pytorch looks beautiful, clean, elegant, (not Tensorflow!!) so does vi editor, Unix OS and the pdf font and also, Python. Minimalist, just enough.]
